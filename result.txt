Then it came chu-chu-chu-chu-chu- chu steadily larger and larger and then, at the moment of the explosion, the front wheels of the engine rose up and all of the earth seemed to rise in a great cloud of blackness and a roar and the engine rose high in the cloud of dirt and of the Wooden ties rising in the air as in a dream and then it fell onto its side like a great wounded animal and there was an explosion of white steam before the clods of the other explosion had ceased to fall on us and the m�quina commenced to speak ta-tat-tat-ta.

29		la			 There was very little of it left and one cup of it took the place of the evening papers, of all the old evenings in caf�s, of all chestnut trees that would be in bloom now in this month, of the great slow horses of the outer boulevards, of book shops, of kiosques, and of galleries, of the Parc Montsouris, of the Stade Buffalo, and of the Butte Chaumont, of the Guaranty Trust Company and the Ile de la Cite, of Foyot's old hotel, and of being able to read and relax in the evening; of all the things he had enjoyed and forgotten and that came back to him when he tasted that opaque, bitter, tongue-numbing, brain-warming, stomach-warming, idea-changing liquid alchemy.  Haven't you heard la gente.  One would take a drink and then shout, `Viva la Anarquia
28		carbine			 With him was another man, also in a black peasant's smock and the dark gray trousers that were almost a uniform in that province, wearing rope-soled shoes and with a carbine slung over his back.  "Salud, Camarada," he said to the man with the carbine and smiled.  "He is the boss here," he grinned, then flexed his arms as though to make the muscles "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 7 stand out and looked at the man with the carbine in a half-mocking admiration

24		submachine			 Deep in one pack he felt the bundled blocks in the sacks, the sacks wrapped in the sleeping robe, and tying the strings of that and pushing the lock shut again, he put his hands into the other and felt the sharp wood outline of the box of the old exploder, the cigar box with the caps, each little cylinder wrapped round and round with its two wires (the lot of them packed as carefully as he had packed his collection of wild bird eggs when he was a boy), the stock of the submachine gun, disconnected from the barrel and wrapped in his leather jacket, the two pans and five clips in one of the inner pockets of the big pack-sack arid the small coils of copper wire and the big coil of light insulated Wire in the other.  He ducked into the cave, found his two packs, opened the one with the submachine gun in it and took out the barrel and stock, slipped the stock onto the forward assembly and put one clip into the gun and three in his pockets.  He reached down and pulled the light automatic rifle with its ventilated barrel, really a submachine gun built to take the 9 mm

22		hilltop			 27 El Sordo was making his fight on a hilltop.

The sentry stood up, leaned his rifle against the wall of the box and stretched, then picked up his rifle, slung it over his shoulder and walked out onto the bridge
21		plaza			 And in my life never do I wish to see such a scene as the flailing to death in the plaza on the top of the cliff above the river.  The balconies of the houses look out on the plaza.  Six streets enter on the plaza and there is an arcade from the houses that goes around the plaza so that one can walk in the shade of the arcade when the sun is hot
20		khaki			 The young man, who was studying the country, took his glasses from the pocket of his faded, khaki flannel shirt, wiped the lenses with a handkerchief, screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he saw the wooden bench beside the door; the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular saw was, and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream.

Then Sordo saw a man, bent double, run from the shelter of the rocks where the automatic rifle was across the open ground to the big boulder behind which the sniper was hidden.  Below on the slope the man who had run from the pile of stones to the shelter of the boulder was speaking to the sniper

She'd be beautiful if they hadn't cropped her hair.  Thou art no colt of a girl with cropped head and the movement of a foal still wet from its mother
16		wineskin			 The wine was good, tasting faintly resinous from the wineskin, but excellent, light and clean on his tongue.  Only Pablo took no interest, sitting by himself with a cup of wine that he replenished by dipping into the big bowl Maria had filled from the wineskin that hung to the left of the entrance to the cave. " the woman of Pablo said when the girl had gone over to the mouth of the cave where she stood by the big wineskin, watching the card players

16		woods			 "He's taken a leather wine bottle to drink alone in the woods," she said.  Maybe you would find out that it never happened and it was not true and it was something you made up like those dreams about the people of the cinema or how all your old girls come back and sleep in that robe at night on all the bare floors, in the straw of the haybarns, the stables, the corrales and the cortijos, the woods, the garages, the trucks and all the hills of Spain.  Below them was the last woods that led to the camp

15		matador			 Now he would like to retire like a matador de toros.  "How many times have I heard matadors talk like that before they took a goring.  Did I live nine years with three of the worst paid matadors in the world not to learn about fear and about safety
15		civiles			 "It was early in the morning when the civiles surrendered at the barracks," Pilar began.  Two civiles were killed.

14		bayonet			 In the sentry box that faced toward them up the road, the sentry was sitting holding his rifle, the bayonet fixed, between his knees.  In the sentry box that faced toward them up the road, the sentry was sitting holding his rifle, the bayonet fixed, between his knees.  Robert Jordan put up his field glasses, shading the lenses carefully with his cupped hands even though there was now no sun to make a glint, and there was the rail of the bridge as clear as though you could reach out and touch it and there was the face of the senty so clear he could see the sunken cheeks, the ash on the cigarette and the greasy shine of the bayonet

13		holster			 Robert Jordan reached for his flask and, bringing the flask out, as he brought it he loosened the pistol in the holster and swung it on top of his thigh.  And when I put it on the joke seemed very good to me, although afterwards I wished I had taken the holster of the pistol instead of the hat. " They were walking through the heather of the mountain meadow and Robert Jordan felt the brushing of the heather against his legs, felt the weight of his pistol in its holster against his thigh, felt the sun on his head, felt the breeze from the snow of the mountain peaks cool on his back and, in his hand, he felt the girl's hand firm and strong, the fingers locked in his

The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes, leaned over, put his arm through one of the leather pack straps and swung the heavy pack up onto his shoulders.

12		kneeling			 She was washing the dishes and the girl, Maria, was drying them and putting them away, kneeling to place them in the hollow dug in the wall that was used as a shelf.

In the big room of the Ayuntamiento they were all kneeling in a half circle praying and the priest was kneeling and praying with them

12		safe-conduct			 There was the Salvoconducto or safe-conduct pass giving his name, age, height, birthplace and mission that Robert Jordan had written out on a sheet from his notebook and sealed with the S.

He felt of the seal, tested it with his forefinger, then handed both the safe-conduct and dispatch back to Andr�s
11		salute			 They had shaken hands and he had saluted and gone out to the staff car where the old man was waiting asleep and in that car they had ridden over the road past Guadarrama, the old man still asleep, and up the Navacerrada road to the Alpine Club hut where he, Robert Jordan, slept for three hours before they started.

But cruelty had entered into the lines and also drunkenness or the beginning of drunkenness and the lines were not as they were when Don Benito had come out.  I do not know how it is in other countries, and no one cares more for the pleasure of drinking than I do, but in Spain drunkenness, when produced by other elements than wine, is a thing of great ugliness and the people do things that they would not have done
11		gallop			 "In my happiness I would like to be on a good horse and ride fast with thee riding fast beside me and we would ride faster and faster, galloping, and never pass my happiness".  The big gray horse was galloping through the pines.  But he had had no choice except this hill and he had picked it as far away as he could see it and galloped for it, the automatic rifle heavy on his back, the horse laboring, barrel heaving between his thighs, the sack of grenades swinging against one side, the sack of automatic rifle pans banging against the other, and Joaqu�n and Ignacio halting and firing, halting and firing to give him time to get the gun in place

It was a peasant's face, the cheeks hollow under the high cheekbones, the beard stubbled, the eyes shaded by the heavy brows, big hands holding the rifle, heavy boots showing beneath the folds of the blanket cape.

10		contour			 Where there had been roughness of fabric all was smooth with a smoothness and firm rounded pressing and a long warm coolness, cool outside and warm within, long and light and closely holding, closely held, lonely, hollow-making with contours, happymaking, young and loving and now all warmly smooth with a hollowing, chest-aching, tight-held loneliness that was such that Robert Jordan felt he could not stand it and he said, "Hast thou loved others.

10		bomber			 These three were Heinkel one-elevens, twin-motor bombers.  It was over his head and he was pulling it down when he heard the next planes coming and he pulled his trousers on under the robe and lay still as three more of the Heinkel bimotor bombers came over.  Before they were gone over the shoulder of the mountain, he had buckled on his pistol, rolled the robe and placed it against the rocks and sat now, close against the rocks, tying his rope-soled shoes when the approaching droning turned to a greater clattering roar than ever before and nine more Heinkel light bombers came in echelons; hammering the sky apart as they went over

9		sullenly			 "I have enough to think about without girls," he said sullenly.  But here no one commands but me," the other said sullenly.  The man with the carbine looked at them both sullenly
9		stirrup			 There were two ordinary vaquero's or herdsman's saddles, like American stock saddles, one very ornate vaquero's saddle, with hand-tooled leather and heavy, hooded stirrups, and two military saddles in black leather.  The horse plunged as though he had been spurred and the young man, still tugging at the scabbard, slid over toward the ground, his right foot caught in the stirrup.  Through the trees he saw where the gray horse had stopped and was standing, his rider still hanging face down from the stirrup

He placed the charges, wedged and lashed them, sunk his caps and crimped them, ran his wires, hooked them up and got back to where he had placed the old box of the exploder and then he started to think of all the things that could have happened and that might go wrong.  There was some wire in it still but the square wooden box of the exploder was gone
9		swinge			 The horse was snatching grass, swinging his head sideways as he pulled, annoyed by the man and his talking.  They were still praying as they had been, the men all kneeling, with their shirts open, some with their heads down, others with their heads up, looking toward the priest and toward the crucifix that he held, and the priest praying fast and hard and looking Out over their heads, and in back of them Pablo, with his cigarette now lighted, was sitting there on the table swinging his legs, his shotgun slung over his back, and he was playing with the key.  He carried them by the legs, heads swinging
9		que			 "C�mo que no, hija.  "Hay que aprovechar el tiempo," Robert Jordan told her.  "Hay que aguantarse
9		parapet			 I mean the endurance of bombardments, the necessity to attack, the life of the parapet".  That is, he had lain down where the ground fell sharply away below the triple belt of wire and shouted up at the rock and earth parapet.  Then, from farther down the parapet, a rifle fired
9		cojones			" "Los cojones," Robert Jordan said.  "But it seems to me that with enough cojones you would not wear skirts".  "Salud y cojones"
9		tripod			 Then she went into the cave and then two men came running out, one with the automatic rifle with its tripod swung on his shoulder; the other with a sackful of the pans.  "One man should hold the tripod still so that the gun does not jump.  If he must fire, hold the legs of the tripod firm for him and hand him the pans when they are empty"
8		thine			com "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 2 No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.  "Wipe thine own spillings," Pilar said to him.  "A comrade of thine," Robert Jordan said
8		flannel			 The young man, who was studying the country, took his glasses from the pocket of his faded, khaki flannel shirt, wiped the lenses with a handkerchief, screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he saw the wooden bench beside the door; the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular saw was, and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream.  The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes, leaned over, put his arm through one of the leather pack straps and swung the heavy pack up onto his shoulders.  Robert Jordan unpinned a safety pin that ran through his pocket flap and took a folded paper out of the left breast pocket of his flannel shirt and handed it to the man, who opened it, looked at it doubtfully and turned it in his hands
8		cursed			 But she weighs enough when we had to carry her and stop to fire and then carry her again with the old woman lashing at Pablo with the rope and carrying his rifle, putting it in his hand when he would drop the girl, making him pick her up again and loading the gun for him while she cursed him; taking the shells from his pouches and shoving them down into the magazine and cursing him.  Agust�n stood there looking down at him and cursed him, speaking slowly, clearly, bitterly and contemptuously and cursing as steadily as though he were dumping manure on a field, lifting it with a dung fork out of a wagon.  He cursed and vilified the hilltop
8		hombre			" "No, hombre. " "No, hombre. " "Yes, hombre
8		dragging			 Ten yokes of oxen dragging a boat with sails out of the sea in the morning with the line of the small waves breaking on the beach.  It was in the Escorial and, except that I woke in the night and thought it was some one else and was excited until I realized who it really was, it was just dragging ashes; except that it was pleasant enough.  She saw him moving slowly, dragging around the ring, smiling, bowing, smiling, his assistants walking behind him, stooping, picking up cigars, tossing back hats; he circling the ring sad-eyed and smiling, to end the circle before her
8		mule			 "Yet they speak of the mule as stubborn," the woman said.  "Let me finish, you mule," Pilar said to him.  "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway146 "Then give me a mule," Robert Jordan grinned
8		cock			 "Pablo pulled and let go as the man had told him and the block snapped forward into place and the pistol was cocked with the hammer back.  Then the woman's big hand shook his shoulder and he was suddenly, completely and absolutely awake and his hand was around the butt of the pistol that lay alongside of his bare right leg and all of him was as cocked as the pistol with its safety catch slipped off.  A cock crowed at the farmhouse that was the fascist post and as he walked along the stream he looked back and saw, through the trunks of the poplars, a light showing at the lower edge of one of the windows of the farmhouse
8		pitchfork			 And those who did not have flails had heavy herdsman's clubs, or ox-goads, and some had wooden pitchforks; those with wooden tines that are used to fork the chaff and straw into the air after the flailing.  And those who did not have flails had heavy herdsman's clubs, or ox-goads, and some had wooden pitchforks; those with wooden tines that are used to fork the chaff and straw into the air after the flailing.  Then the two lines fell back and let him lay the dust over the center of the plaza; the hose sweeping in wide arcs and the water glistening in the sun and the men leaning on their flails or the clubs or the white wood pitchforks and watching the sweep of the stream of water
8		orderly			 The lines now were neither straight nor orderly and there was much and very grave drunkenness.  The lines now were neither straight nor orderly and there was much and very grave drunkenness.  When he first saw the boy, out at Hans' Brigade Staff, the other five from the village had all been killed and the boy was in very bad shape and they were using him as an orderly to wait on table at the staff
8		trot			 In a snowstorm you rode up to a moose and he mistook your horse for another moose and trotted forward to meet you.  Then he heard a horse coming, the hoofs balled with the wet snow thumping dully as the horseman trotted.  The four of them trotted into the timber and Agust�n said softly, "Cabrones
8		bough			 There close to the rock, he had held the tree upright, holding the trunk firm with one hand, and, holding the ax- haft close to the head had lopped off all the boughs until he had a pile of them.  Then, leaving the pile of boughs, he had laid the bare pole of the trunk down in the snow and gone into the cave to get a slab of wood he had seen against the wall.  With this slab he scraped the ground clear of the snow along the rock wall and then picked up his boughs and shaking them clean of snow laid them in rows, like overlapping plumes, until he had a bed
8		scabbard			 He heard the noise of a carbine scabbard slapping loosely and the creak of leather.  From the scabbard on the right of his saddle projected the stock and the long oblong clip of a short automatic rifle.  He reached his hand down toward the scabbard and as he swung low, turning and jerking at the scabbard, Robert Jordan saw the scarlet of the formalized device he wore on the left breast of his khaki blanket cape
8		pack-horse			" The gypsy was holding the lead rope with the pack-horse pulling his head taut behind him.  "Drop the pack-horse and gallop.  I can't take the damned pack-horse, Robert Jordan thought
7		bombardment			 There will be an aerial bombardment as preparation.  I mean the endurance of bombardments, the necessity to attack, the life of the parapet".  But let me be close to him, O Lord, and may his instructions be exact for I do not think that I could control myself under the bombardment of the planes
7		stallion			 "That," said Robert Jordan, pointing to one of the bays, a big stallion with a white blaze on his forehead and a single white foot, the near front, "is much horse".  "The best horse that you have, the white-faced bay stallion, has a swelling on the upper part of the cannon bone that I do not like".  The three of them stood now by the rope corral and the patchy sunlight shone on the coat of the bay stallion
7		tawny			 Her teeth were white in her brown face and her skin and her eyes were the same golden tawny brown.  So he thought about the girl Maria, with her skin, the hair and the eyes all the same golden tawny brown, the hair a little darker than the rest but it would be lighter as her skin tanned deeper, the smooth skin, pale gold on the surface with a darkness underneath.  By now they're well beyond the pass with Castile all yellow and tawny beneath them now in the morning, the yellow crossed by white roads and spotted with the small villages and the shadows of the Heinkels moving over the land as the shadows of sharks pass over a sandy floor of the ocean
7		boar			" "The boar, the bear, the wolf, the ibex" "You like to hunt.  "In my house, when I had a house, and now I have no house, there were the tusks of boar I had shot in the lower forest.  And now, he is as finished and as ended as a boar that has been altered, Anselmo thought, and, when the altering has been accomplished and the squealing is over you cast the two stones away and the boar, that is a boar no longer, goes snouting and rooting up to them and eats them
7		stubble			 This man had short gray hair and a gray stubble of beard and wore the usual black smock buttoned at the neck.  Except that their faces were covered with the small stubble of this their last morning of not yet being shaved and they stood there against the wall and said nothing. " He stroked his chin and his cheeks where the threeday growth made a blond stubble
7		gore			 "Until he is gored," the woman said bitterly.  "How many times have I heard matadors talk like that before they took a goring.  How often have I heard Finito say that it is all knowledge and that the bull never gored the man; rather the man gored himself on the horn of the bull
7		gente			 Haven't you heard la gente.  "They are very serious gente".  The gente
7		tal			 "Qu� tal.  "Qu� tal.  Qu� tal
7		qu			 "Por qu�, do not say it," the woman said, still not looking at either of them. " "A mi qu�.  "Mira qu� caballo," he said
7		horseman			 Then he heard a horse coming, the hoofs balled with the wet snow thumping dully as the horseman trotted.  He saw the girl's cropped head disappear with a jerk under the robe and then he saw the horseman coming through the trees.  The horseman was almost opposite him now
6		whittle			 He was cutting away on a stick with a knife and he stared at them as they came up, then went on whittling.  "Don't leave it so close to the cave," the whittling man, who had blue eyes in a dark, good-looking lazy gypsy face, the color of smoked leather, said.  It was a figure four trap and he was whittling the crossbar for it
6		slanted			 Her legs slanted long and clean from the open cuffs of the trousers as she sat with her hands across her knees and he could see the shape of her small up-tilted breasts under the gray shirt.  Then through this noise came another noise, a steady, racketing drone and they saw the sentry looking up, his knitted cap slanted back, and turning their heads and looking up they saw, high in the evening sky, three monoplanes in V formation, showing minute and silvery at that height where there still was sun, passing unbelievably quickly across the sky, their motors now throbbing steadily.  "Take this and make a mark for tanks thus," he drew a slanted tank, "and then a mark for each one and when there are four, cross the four strokes for the fifth"
6		es			 "No es nada," she said.  "Pero es muy vivo.  "Pues es muy raro
6		sickness			 "Pablo has a sickness for her already.  It lies on him like a sickness when he sees her.  Then said, "It is true that there is no sickness
6		brook			 It was wide enough for two motor cars to pass and it spanned, in solid-flung metal grace, a deep gorge at the bottom of which, far below, a brook leaped in white water through rocks and boulders down to the main stream of the pass.  It was wide enough for two motor cars to pass and it spanned, in solid-flung metal grace, a deep gorge at the bottom of which, far below, a brook leaped in white water through rocks and boulders down to the main stream of the pass.  The gorge was almost a canyon here, where the brook, that the bridge was flung over, merged with the main stream of the pass
6		brazier			 There was a charcoal brazier outside the sentry box, made from an old petrol tin with the top cut off and holes punched in it, which rested on two stones; but he held no fire.  There is the fire in his brazier".  Sometimes he could not see it and then he knew that the man in the sentry box had moved in front of the brazier
6		comport			 "I do not know how I would comport myself.  "I do not say that he was a coward because he comported himself very well," Pilar went on.  Help me, O Lord, tomorrow to comport myself as a man should in his last hours
6		dew			 The grass was lush underfoot after the pineneedle floor of the forest and the dew on the grass wet through their canvas rope-soled shoes.  There was no wind, and, outside now of the warm air of the cave, heavy with smoke of both tobacco and charcoal, with the odor of cooked rice and meat, saffron, pimentos, and oil, the tarry, wine-spilled smell of the big skin hung beside the door, hung by the neck and the four legs extended, wine drawn from a plug fitted in one leg, wine that spilled a little onto the earth of the floor, settling the dust smell; out now from the odors of different herbs whose names he did not know that hung in bunches from the ceiling, with long ropes of garlic, away now from the copper-penny, red wine and garlic, horse sweat and man sweat dried in the clothing (acrid and gray the man sweat, sweet and sickly the dried brushed-off lather of horse sweat), of the men at the table, Robert Jordan breathed deeply of the clear night air of the mountains that smelled of the pines and of the dew on the grass in the meadow by the stream.  "These lines were quiet and it was a clear day, as today is clear, and there were clouds high in the sky, as there are now, and the plaza was not yet dusty for there had been a heavy dew in the night, and the trees cast a shade over the men in the lines and you could hear the water running from the brass pipe in the mouth of the lion and falling into the bowl of the fountain where the women bring the water jars to fill them
6		smoky			 It was warm and smoky in the cave.  They had come in out of the storm to the smoky warmth of the cave and the woman had motioned Robert Jordan over to her with a nod of her head.  He dropped the blanket and came back into the smoky cave
6		stirring			 The girl knelt by her stirring in an iron pot.  The girl knelt by her stirring in an iron pot.  "Of course he was tubercular," Pilar said, standing there with the big wooden stirring spoon in her hand
6		ani			 "I do not like anis," Pablo said.  "It smells of anis but it is bitter as gall," he said. ' "The drunkards were handing around bottles of anis and cognac that they had looted from the bar of the club of the fascists, drinking them down like wine, and many of the men in the lines were beginning to be a little drunk, too, from drinking after the strong emotion of Don Benito, Don Federico, Don Ricardo and especially Don Faustino
6		receding			 Then came a new and louder droning roar and three more Heinkel one-elevens showed coming steeply, stiffly, lower yet, crossing in rigid formation, their pounding roar approaching in crescendo to an absolute of noise and then receding as they passed the clearing.  Then came a new and louder droning roar and three more Heinkel one-elevens showed coming steeply, stiffly, lower yet, crossing in rigid formation, their pounding roar approaching in crescendo to an absolute of noise and then receding as they passed the clearing.  He could still hear the receding drone
6		clatter			 Before they were gone over the shoulder of the mountain, he had buckled on his pistol, rolled the robe and placed it against the rocks and sat now, close against the rocks, tying his rope-soled shoes when the approaching droning turned to a greater clattering roar than ever before and nine more Heinkel light bombers came in echelons; hammering the sky apart as they went over.  Just then three Heinkel fighters in V formation came low over the clearing coming toward them, just over the tree tops, like clattering, wing-tilting, pinch-nosed ugly toys, to enlarge suddenly, fearfully to their actual size; pouring past in a whining roar.  She saw him now clearly as he furled the heavy flannel cloth around the stick; the flannel hanging blood-heavy from the passes where it had swept over the bull's head and shoulders and the wet streaming shine of his withers and on down and over his back as the bull raised into the air and the banderillas clattered
6		chaff			 And those who did not have flails had heavy herdsman's clubs, or ox-goads, and some had wooden pitchforks; those with wooden tines that are used to fork the chaff and straw into the air after the flailing.  And those who did not have flails had heavy herdsman's clubs, or ox-goads, and some had wooden pitchforks; those with wooden tines that are used to fork the chaff and straw into the air after the flailing. ' "`We thresh fascists today,' said one, `and out of the chaff comes the freedom of this pueblo
6		red-and-black			 He had a red-and-black handkerchief around his neck. ' "The other drunkard who was still lying on his back, took hold of the ankle of the drunkard who was shouting and rolled over so that the shouting drunkard fell with him, and they rolled over together and then sat up and the one who had pulled the other down put his arm around the shouter's neck and then handed the shouter a bottle and kissed the red-and-black handkerchief he wore and they both drank together.  "Now the mob was pressed tight against the door so that those in front were being crushed by all the others who were pressing and from the square a big drunkard in a black smock with a red-and-black handkerchief around his neck, ran and threw himself against the press of the mob and fell forward onto the pressing men and then stood up and backed away and then ran forward again and threw himself against the backs of those men who were pushing, shouting, `Long live me and long live Anarchy
6		spout			 Robert Jordan poured a big drink of Scotch into the glass and El Sordo watched him eagerly and when he had finished, handed him the water jug and Robert Jordan filled the glass with the cold water that ran in a stream from the earthenware spout as he tipped up the jug.  Robert Jordan poured a big drink of Scotch into the glass and El Sordo watched him eagerly and when he had finished, handed him the water jug and Robert Jordan filled the glass with the cold water that ran in a stream from the earthenware spout as he tipped up the jug.  In the dust and the heat, the shouting, the bull and man and wine smell, he had been in the first of the crowd that threw themselves onto the bull and he knew the feeling when the bull rocked and bucked under him and he lay across the withers with one arm locked around the base of the horn and his hand holding the other horn tight, his fingers locked as his body tossed and wrenched and his left arm felt as though it would tear from the socket while he lay on the hot, dusty, bristly, tossing slope of muscle, the ear clenched tight in his teeth, and drove his knife again and again and again into the swelling, tossing bulge of the neck that was now spouting hot on his fist as he let his weight hang on the high slope of the withers and banged and banged into the neck
6		threescore			 Maybe that is my life and instead of it being threescore years and ten it is fortyeight hours or just threescore hours and ten or twelve rather.  Maybe that is my life and instead of it being threescore years and ten it is fortyeight hours or just threescore hours and ten or twelve rather.  Maybe that is my life and instead of it being threescore years and ten it is fortyeight hours or just threescore hours and ten or twelve rather
6		tu			 "De tu propia voluntad," the words were in Spanish. " "Como tu," he said.  "Ni tu, ni Dios"
6		withers			 She saw him now clearly as he furled the heavy flannel cloth around the stick; the flannel hanging blood-heavy from the passes where it had swept over the bull's head and shoulders and the wet streaming shine of his withers and on down and over his back as the bull raised into the air and the banderillas clattered. " She could hear the voice and then see the first bend of the knee as he started forward and watch his voyage in onto the horn that lowered now magically as the bull's muzzle followed the low swept cloth, the thin, brown wrist controlled, sweeping the horns down and past, as the sword entered the dusty height of the withers.  The big gray was sweating and shivering a little and Robert Jordan patted him on the withers
6		manzanilla			 Give me some of that manzanilla.  So I watched him drink, very rapidly, almost a bottle of the manzanilla.  He was drinking more manzanilla now and his eyes were very bright, and he was nodding very happily to every one
6		dung			 Agust�n stood there looking down at him and cursed him, speaking slowly, clearly, bitterly and contemptuously and cursing as steadily as though he were dumping manure on a field, lifting it with a dung fork out of a wagon.  Agust�n stood there looking down at him and cursed him, speaking slowly, clearly, bitterly and contemptuously and cursing as steadily as though he were dumping manure on a field, lifting it with a dung fork out of a wagon.  And the quantity of dung he ate both from me and from thee"
6		vile			 Agust�n said something vile to him.  "Surely you could not expect one of Don Roberto's education to do such vile things".  Thou hast a vile tongue
6		purging			 You learned the dry-mouthed, fear-purged, purging ecstasy of battle and you fought that summer and that fall for all the poor in the world, against all tyranny, for all the things that you believed and for the new world you had been educated into.  You learned the dry-mouthed, fear-purged, purging ecstasy of battle and you fought that summer and that fall for all the poor in the world, against all tyranny, for all the things that you believed and for the new world you had been educated into.  "Here it reports the purging of more of thy famous Russians
6		conscript			 We are making a huge conscript army without the time to implant the discipline that a conscript army must have, to behave properly under fire.

We are making a huge conscript army without the time to implant the discipline that a conscript army must have, to behave properly under fire
6		plume			 With this slab he scraped the ground clear of the snow along the rock wall and then picked up his boughs and shaking them clean of snow laid them in rows, like overlapping plumes, until he had a bed.  With this slab he scraped the ground clear of the snow along the rock wall and then picked up his boughs and shaking them clean of snow laid them in rows, like overlapping plumes, until he had a bed.  Do you remember the cabinet in your father's office with the arrowheads spread out on a shelf, and the eagle feathers of the war bonnets that hung on the wall, their plumes slanting, the smoked buckskin smell of the leggings and the shirts and the feel of the beaded moccasins
6		sap			 He smelled the odor of the pine boughs under him, the piney smell of the crushed needles and the sharper odor of the resinous sap from the cut limbs.  He smelled the odor of the pine boughs under him, the piney smell of the crushed needles and the sharper odor of the resinous sap from the cut limbs.  There was little difference at first, although there was a definite beginning, as when the pump starts and the rubber of the tube crawls a little, but it came now as steadily as a tide rising or the sap rising in a tree until he began to feel the first edge of that negation of apprehension that often turned into actual happiness before action
6		thumping			 Then he heard a horse coming, the hoofs balled with the wet snow thumping dully as the horseman trotted.  Then he heard a horse coming, the hoofs balled with the wet snow thumping dully as the horseman trotted.  Before daylight I heard the male thumping in the snow
6		cago			 He fired and said, "Me cago en tal; I missed him again".  "Me cago en la leche," Andr�s shouted.  "But me cago en la leche, but I will be content when it starts"
6		jutting			 From where he looked the line of the hilltop showed the scattered rocks, the belly, projecting legs, shod hooves jutting out, of Sordo's horse, and the fresh dirt thrown up by the digging.  From where he looked the line of the hilltop showed the scattered rocks, the belly, projecting legs, shod hooves jutting out, of Sordo's horse, and the fresh dirt thrown up by the digging.  There, holding the blanket aside with one hand, the short automatic rifle muzzle with its flash-cone jutting above his shoulder, was Pablo standing short, wide, bristly-faced, his small red-rimmed eyes looking toward no one in particular
6		hemorrhage			 It was as good a thing for his spirit as a saline injection is for a man who has suffered a great hemorrhage.  It was as good a thing for his spirit as a saline injection is for a man who has suffered a great hemorrhage.  "It hurts much and there is much hemorrhage inside
6		mutiny			 They have been forced to quell the mutinies with automatic rifle and machine-gun fire.  They have been forced to quell the mutinies with automatic rifle and machine-gun fire.  He recognized his bushy eyebrows, his watery gray eyes, his chin and the double chin under it, and he knew him for one of France's great modern revolutionary figures who had led the mutiny of the French Navy in the Black Sea
6		detonator			 So was the cigar box with the carefully wrapped and packed detonators.  Why couldn't he have just mucked off and not have taken the exploder and the detonators.  And that Pablo that just mucked off with my exploder and my box of detonators
6		motorcyclist			 He had then roused his adjutant, turned over the battalion to him, and sent his orderly to wake up and bring his motorcyclist.  Instead of sending Andr�s back to brigade headquarters with the motorcyclist, Gomez had decided to take him there himself in order to expedite things and, with Andr�s holding tight onto the seat ahead of him, they roared, bumping down the shell-pocked mountain road between the double row of big trees, the headlight of the motorcycle showing their whitewashed bases and the places on the trunks where the whitewash and the bark had been chipped and torn by shell fragments and bullets during the fighting along this road in the first summer of the movement.  Gomez leaned the motorcycle against the wall as a motorcyclist in a leather suit, showing against the light from inside the building as the door opened, came out of the door with a dispatch case hung over his shoulder, a wooden-holstered Mauser pistol swung against his hip
6		culvert			 The driver and the two men who had been with him were running toward a culvert.  See those coming out of the culvert.  The man was down in the road halfway between the culvert and the truck
5		buckskin			 There were five horses in the rope corral, three bays, a sorrel, and a buckskin.  Robert Jordan slipped through between the double rope of the corral and slapped the buckskin on the haunch.  Do you remember the cabinet in your father's office with the arrowheads spread out on a shelf, and the eagle feathers of the war bonnets that hung on the wall, their plumes slanting, the smoked buckskin smell of the leggings and the shirts and the feel of the beaded moccasins
5		dismount			 "They had dismounted on the road between Segovia and Santa Maria del Real.  They had dismounted to ask papers of the driver of a cart.  "If they are dismounted point thy rifle muzzle at the ground
5		unprintable			 The gypsy did not move but said something unprintable, then, "Leave it there.  And when thou comest to the camp, order that some one should relieve me because I have indescribable and unprintable hunger and I have forgotten the password".  "Go to the unprintable," Agust�n said
5		gorse			 We were going up that hill breast high in the gorse and heather.  The fascists had attacked and we had stopped them on that slope in the gray rocks, the scrub pines and the gorse of the Guadarrama hillsides.  The smell of the sea as you walk through the gorse on a headland in Galicia
5		clenched			" went the gypsy shaking his two clenched fists up and down in front of him, thumbs up, on an imaginary machine gun. ' "Just then, one of the drunkards got to his feet and raised both arms with his fists clenched over his head and shouted, `Long live Anarchy and Liberty and I obscenity in the milk of the Republic.  Her fist, clenched tight in his pocket, beat hard against his thigh
5		voy			 "Me voy," the gypsy said.  "Pues me voy," Pilar said.  "Me voy
5		repugnant			 Here is a stagnation that is repugnant".  It is repugnant to me and it is not how one should act for the cause".  One dying in such a place can be very ugly, dirty and repugnant
5		lo			 "Ya lo veo," he said in Spanish.  lo sabes. " "Ya lo s�," said Primitivo
5		throb			 Then through this noise came another noise, a steady, racketing drone and they saw the sentry looking up, his knitted cap slanted back, and turning their heads and looking up they saw, high in the evening sky, three monoplanes in V formation, showing minute and silvery at that height where there still was sun, passing unbelievably quickly across the sky, their motors now throbbing steadily.  Then he heard the first high, throbbing murmur of a plane coming.  Then the plane was overhead, its shadows passing over the open glade, the throbbing reaching its maximum of portent
5		forefinger			 "I let it down with my thumb and forefinger".  "But I have a grip of thumb and forefinger beyond description.  He put his right forefinger out to show them
5		pliers			 In the pocket with the wire he felt his pliers and the two wooden awls for making holes in the end of the blocks and then, from the last inside pocket, he took a big box of the Russian cigarettes of the lot he had from Golz's headquarters and tying the mouth of the pack shut, he pushed the lock in, buckled the flaps down and again covered both packs with the canvas.  He had a coil of wire around one arm and a pair of pliers hung by a thong from his wrist.  Too damned much firing, and he was lashing two grenades side by side on top of the braced blocks of explosive, winding wire over their corrugations so they would hold tight and firm and lashing it tight; twisting it with the pliers
5		plier			 In the pocket with the wire he felt his pliers and the two wooden awls for making holes in the end of the blocks and then, from the last inside pocket, he took a big box of the Russian cigarettes of the lot he had from Golz's headquarters and tying the mouth of the pack shut, he pushed the lock in, buckled the flaps down and again covered both packs with the canvas.

Too damned much firing, and he was lashing two grenades side by side on top of the braced blocks of explosive, winding wire over their corrugations so they would hold tight and firm and lashing it tight; twisting it with the pliers
5		idiocy			 Because he can see the results of an idiocy in advance.  "In this war there is an idiocy without bounds".  "We swim within the idiocy for a year now
5		lanyard			 The robe was spread on the forest floor in the lee of the rocks beyond the cave mouth and as he slept, he turned, and turning rolled on his pistol which was fastened by a lanyard to one wrist and had been by his side under the cover when he went to sleep, shoulder and back weary, leg-tired, his muscles pulled with tiredness so that the ground was soft, and simply stretching in the robe against the flannel lining was voluptuous with fatigue.  Under his head, as he lay on his side, was the bulge of the trousers and the coat that he had wrapped around his shoes to make a pillow and against his side was the cold metal of the big automatic pistol he had taken from the holster when he undressed and fastened by its lanyard to his right wrist.  So he rolled away onto his side and pulled the robe over her head and kissed her once on her neck under the robe and then pulled the pistol lanyard up and put the pistol by his side where he could reach it handily and then he lay there in the night thinking
5		poncho			 A man came out of the timber, a blanket worn over his head like a poncho Robert Jordan saw it was Pablo and that he was smoking a cigarette.  He was riding a big gray gelding and he wore a khaki beret, a blanket cape like a poncho, and heavy black boots.  Cut the head off and wrap it in a poncho"
5		echelon			 Before they were gone over the shoulder of the mountain, he had buckled on his pistol, rolled the robe and placed it against the rocks and sat now, close against the rocks, tying his rope-soled shoes when the approaching droning turned to a greater clattering roar than ever before and nine more Heinkel light bombers came in echelons; hammering the sky apart as they went over.  Just then they heard them, the higher, whining drone, and as they passed at about five thousand feet, Robert Jordan counted fifteen Fiats in echelon of echelons like a wild-goose flight of the V-shaped threes.  Just then they heard them, the higher, whining drone, and as they passed at about five thousand feet, Robert Jordan counted fifteen Fiats in echelon of echelons like a wild-goose flight of the V-shaped threes
5		airfield			 They're going on to Colmenar, to Escorial, or to the flying field at Manzanares el Real, he thought, with the old castle above the lake with the ducks in the reeds and the fake airfield just behind the real field with the dummy planes, not quite hidden, their props turning in the wind.  "They go to bomb an airfield," Robert Jordan told him as they went into the cave.  "They go to bomb an airfield I believe
5		camion			 "A few camions as usual.  "We trucked freight across the mountains with the big carts before the camions came into use.  "There were four camions which passed on the road
5		aught			 Have you heard aught of this.  "Do you know aught of such things.  "There we can be married in it if it means aught to thee
5		slipping			 "`Then let us kneel,' the first civil said, and the four knelt, looking very awkward with their heads against the wall and their hands by their sides, and Pablo passed behind them and shot each in turn in the back of the head with the pistol, going from one to another and putting the barrel of the pistol against the back of their heads, each man slipping down as he fired.  She was gone now and he saw her from the corner of his eye, slipping along the side of the cave toward the fire and now Robert Jordan watched Pablo's face.  But this time when he talked about Madrid there was no slipping into make-believe "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway186 again
5		taut			 She saw its brightness going in slowly and steadily as though the bull's rush plucked it into himself and out from the man's hand and she watched it move in until the brown knuckles rested against the taut hide and the short, brown man whose eyes had never left the entry place of the sword now swung his sucked-in belly clear of the horn and rocked clear from the animal, to stand holding the cloth on the stick in his left hand, raising his right hand to watch the bull die.  She saw the eyes closed and the solemn brown face and the curly black hair pushed back now from the forehead and she was sitting by him on the bed rubbing the legs, chafing the taut muscles of the calves, kneading them, loosening them, and then tapping them lightly with her folded hands, loosening the cramped muscles.  Then he was on the road and it was still clear below on the road and then he was moving fast backwards up the little washed-out gully by the lower side of the road as an outfielder goes backwards for a long fly ball, keeping the wire taut, and now he was almost opposite Anselmo's stone and it was still clear below the bridge
5		motorcar			 As he crouched, rubbing his feet, he heard a motorcar on the road.  Then the car was gone up the road and Anselmo reached into the inside of his jacket and took out from his shirt pocket the two sheets torn from Robert Jordan's notebook and made a mark after the drawing of a motorcar.  But he was not there and the old man simply made a mark for a motorcar going up the road, on the sheet of note paper
5		seest			 "I am drunk, seest thou.  "Kiss one, Ingl�s, for thy knowledge's sake and then, with this in thy nostrils, walk back up into the city and when thou seest a refuse pail with dead flowers in it plunge thy nose deep into it and inhale so that scent mixes with those thou hast already in thy nasal passages".  "Thou seest
5		plateau			 He wished that he had seen the fighting on the plateau beyond Guadalajara when they beat the Italians.  He had not arrived in Madrid until January and while Robert Jordan had fought at Carabanchel and at Usera in those three days when they stopped the right wing of the fascist attack on Madrid and drove the Moors and the Tercio back from house to house to clear that battered suburb on the edge of the gray, sun-baked plateau and establish a line of defense along the heights that would protect that corner of the city, Karkov had been in Madrid.  It is always possible they will try again at Guadalajara, not stupidly as "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway180 before, but with three main fingers coming down to broaden it out and carry it along the railway to the west of the plateau
5		anarchist			 It only kept the anarchists from getting them.  "And afterwards shoot the anarchists and the Communists and all this canalla except the good Republicans," Agust�n said.  That's the way our friends the anarchists talk
5		periodical			 "But in the fascist periodicals it says there are hundreds of thousands".  She had read of them in a periodical.  She had read of them in a periodical
5		matadero			 After that of the ship you must go down the hill in Madrid to the Puente de Toledo early in the morning to the matadero and stand there on the wet paving when there is a fog from the Manzanares and wait for the old women who go before daylight to drink the blood of the beasts that are slaughtered.  When such an old woman comes out of the matadero, holding her shawl around hei with her face gray and her eyes hollow, and the whiskers of age on her chin, "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway139 and on her cheeks, set in the waxen white of her face as the sprouts grow from the seed of the bean, not bristles, but pale sprouts in the death of her face; put your arms tight around her, Ingl�s, and hold her to you and kiss her on the mouth and you will know the second part that odor is made of".  But if the Ingl�s must learn that odor that he covets to recognize he must go to the matadero early in the morning"
5		beret			 He was riding a big gray gelding and he wore a khaki beret, a blanket cape like a poncho, and heavy black boots.  He saw the faces of the men, the sabers hanging, the sweat-darkened flanks of the horses, and the cone-like slope of the khaki capes, and the Navarrese slant of the khaki berets.  A large man, old and heavy, in an oversized khaki beret, such as chasseurs a pied wear in the French Army, wearing an overcoat, carrying a map case and wearing a pistol strapped around his greatcoat, got out of the back of the car with two other men in the uniform of the International Brigades
5		cavalryman			 That cavalryman did not expect anything, he was thinking.  Was the cavalryman killed.  There were no clouds in the sky and Robert Jordan sat in the rocks with his shirt off browning his back in the sun and reading the letters that had been in the pockets of the dead cavalryman
5		caballo			 "Mira qu� caballo," he said.  "Qu� caballo m�s bonito," he said and patted the big gray again.  "Qu� caballo m�s hermoso
5		puta			 "You hijo de la gran puta. Hijos de puta.  "Me cago en su puta madre
5		chancre			 He did not like this hill and when he saw it he thought it had the shape of a chancre.  El Sordo was thinking: It is shaped like a chancre.  And this hill is like a chancre
5		dugout			 It will probably be a cave or dugout, a refuge, and wires will run to it.  He took them into a dugout and looked at them with the light of a candle.  With the sun just starting to come through the high branches of the pine trees, Gomez and Andr�s followed the chauffeur, whose name was Vicente, through the pines across the road and up the slope to the entrance of a dugout from the roof of which signal wires ran on up over the wooded slope
5		bristly			 Karkov went over to another man of about forty-eight, who was short, chunky, jovial- looking with pale blue eyes, thinning blond hair and a gay mouth under a bristly yellow moustache.  In the dust and the heat, the shouting, the bull and man and wine smell, he had been in the first of the crowd that threw themselves onto the bull and he knew the feeling when the bull rocked and bucked under him and he lay across the withers with one arm locked around the base of the horn and his hand holding the other horn tight, his fingers locked as his body tossed and wrenched and his left arm felt as though it would tear from the socket while he lay on the hot, dusty, bristly, tossing slope of muscle, the ear clenched tight in his teeth, and drove his knife again and again and again into the swelling, tossing bulge of the neck that was now spouting hot on his fist as he let his weight hang on the high slope of the withers and banged and banged into the neck.  Just then Agust�n saw Pablo coming over the edge of the gorge, pulling himself over on hands and knees, his bristly face running with sweat
5		unreal			 He had an unreal feeling about all of this now as though he had said it all before or as though it were a train that were going, especially as though it were a train and he was standing on the platform of a railway station.  He had accepted being killed so completely that all of this now seemed unreal.  He could feel, solidly, how unreal it all was through the absolute reality and he looked down at the bridge and then back to the sentry lying on the road, to where Anselmo lay, to Fernando against the bank and back up the smooth, brown road to the stalled truck and still it was unreal
5		whish			 The gun was firing now with the rocket whish and the cracking, dirt-spouting boom.  The pack-horse was ahead of him swinging too far to the right and slowing down and Robert Jordan, galloping, his head turned a little toward the bridge, saw the line of trucks halted behind the turn that showed now clearly as he was gaining height, and he saw the bright yellow flash that signalled the instant whish and boom, and the shell fell short, but he heard the metal sailing from where the dirt rose. " and felt his big horse's chest surging with the steepening of the slope and saw the gray neck stretching and the gray ears ahead and he reached and patted the wet gray neck, and he looked back at the bridge and saw the bright flash from the heavy, squat, mud-colored tank there on the road and then he did not hear any "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway246 whish but only a banging acrid smelling clang like a boiler being ripped apart and he was under the gray horse and the gray horse was kicking and he was trying to pull out from under the weight
4		sawdust			 The young man, who was studying the country, took his glasses from the pocket of his faded, khaki flannel shirt, wiped the lenses with a handkerchief, screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he saw the wooden bench beside the door; the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular saw was, and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream.  And all that damned sawdust.  Those big piles of sawdust
4		sorrel			 There were five horses in the rope corral, three bays, a sorrel, and a buckskin.  There were five horses in the rope corral, three bays, a sorrel, and a buckskin.  "The sorrel is lame in the off hind foot," he said to Pablo, not looking at him
4		white-faced			 "The best horse that you have, the white-faced bay stallion, has a swelling on the upper part of the cannon bone that I do not like".  "Thou lovely white-faced big beauty.  But when Marty put his finger on the map in Golz's staff the scarheaded, white-faced General's jaw muscles would tighten and he would think, "I should shoot you, Andr� Marty, before I let you put that gray rotten finger on a contour map of mine
4		del			 "They had dismounted on the road between Segovia and Santa Maria del Real.  One here and the other over the Alto del Leon near the Escorial.  "El Palacio del Miedo," Anselmo said
4		gloomily			 "That is what happens to everybody," Pablo said, gloomily.  He looked at the horses gloomily.  "I am not of those who speak gloomily"
4		hadst			 Until thou hadst horses thou wert with us.  `And thee hadst best watch thy mouth if thou dost not want to walk between the lines.  "If thou hadst seen it thou wouldst not call it a novel," Primitivo said
4		terminated			 "But now he is terminated.  "You have terminated already.  "The moon of May has not yet terminated"
4		thickening			 Robert Jordan felt the ache in his throat and his voice thickening.  Robert Jordan felt the ache in his throat and his voice thickening.  "I, too," said Robert Jordan, and could feel his voice thickening
4		needest			 "Hast thou seen what thou needest.  When thou needest to kill a man and instead did what you did.  Blow it if thou needest to
4		thinkest			 "And what thinkest thou of this of the bridge.  Thou thinkest there will be an afterwards from this bridge.  "Sordo, when thinkest thou the planes will come
4		disposition			 Then we will make the dispositions for the rest.  There has been no abnormal movement on the road and I know the dispositions and the habits of this post at the sawmill across the road.  He noticed all the dispositions that had been made of the troops and then he ordered the dead men's horses to be brought up and the bodies tied across the saddles so that they might be packed in to La Granja
4		choky			 And she blushed with he looked at her, and she sitting, her hands clasped around her knees and the shirt open at the throat, the cup of her breasts uptilted against the shirt, and as he thought of her, his throat was choky and there was a difficulty in walking and he and Anselmo spoke no more until the old man said, "Now we go down through these rocks and to the camp".  And she blushed with he looked at her, and she sitting, her hands clasped around her knees and the shirt open at the throat, the cup of her breasts uptilted against the shirt, and as he thought of her, his throat was choky and there was a difficulty in walking and he and Anselmo spoke no more until the old man said, "Now we go down through these rocks and to the camp".  "Give me a rifle here," Robert Jordan heard him say in a choky voice
4		snick			" They heard a rifle bolt snick as it was drawn back and then the knock against the wood as it was pushed forward and down on the stock. " They heard a rifle bolt snick as it was drawn back and then the knock against the wood as it was pushed forward and down on the stock. " He heard a bolt snick as it was pulled back
4		flint			 Then striking a flint and steel together he held it up and blowing on the end of the cork, looked at the young man's face in its glow.  Then striking a flint and steel together he held it up and blowing on the end of the cork, looked at the young man's face in its glow.  Give me a cigarette, Ingl�s," she said and taking it, lit it from a flint and steel lighter in the pocket of her skirt
4		knowest			 "And knowest thou not what it is for.  Thou knowest that if thou wilt be reasonable.  "But I am glad thou knowest about such things as you have told me for that means thou hast been with many women and the Pilar told me that it is only such men who are possible for husbands
4		hearth			 The wife of Pablo was standing over the charcoal fire on the open fire hearth in the corner of the cave.  The girl came in and walked across to the low table by the hearth and picked up the enameled-ware bowls and brought them to the table.  It was so quiet in the cave, suddenly, that he could hear the hissing noise the wood made burning on the hearth where Pilar cooked
4		acrid			 The acrid smell had carried across the table and he had picked out the one familiar component.  There was no wind, and, outside now of the warm air of the cave, heavy with smoke of both tobacco and charcoal, with the odor of cooked rice and meat, saffron, pimentos, and oil, the tarry, wine-spilled smell of the big skin hung beside the door, hung by the neck and the four legs extended, wine drawn from a plug fitted in one leg, wine that spilled a little onto the earth of the floor, settling the dust smell; out now from the odors of different herbs whose names he did not know that hung in bunches from the ceiling, with long ropes of garlic, away now from the copper-penny, red wine and garlic, horse sweat and man sweat dried in the clothing (acrid and gray the man sweat, sweet and sickly the dried brushed-off lather of horse sweat), of the men at the table, Robert Jordan breathed deeply of the clear night air of the mountains that smelled of the pines and of the dew on the grass in the meadow by the stream.  His face was down against the pebbles as the bridge settled where it had risen and the familiar yellow smell of it rolled over him in acrid smoke and then it commenced to rain pieces of steel
4		firelight			 Her face was lit by the fire and it was flushed and it shone warm and dark and handsome now in the firelight as it was meant to be.  He stood in front of the fire, his long arms hanging by his sides, his cheeks, stubble-shadowed below the cheekbones, hollow in the firelight.  The firelight lit up her face
4		goring			 "How many times have I heard matadors talk like that before they took a goring.  Always do they talk that way in their arrogance before a goring.  They are worse than a goring, for the injury is internal and it does not heal
4		barefooted			 "Thee came barefooted," he said.  "Thee came barefooted," he said.  He was barefooted as when he had been taken from his home and he walked ahead of Pablo holding his hands above his head, and Pablo walked behind him with the barrels of his shotgun pressing against the back of Don Federico Gonzalez until Don Federico entered the double line
4		miserably			 "It is on them very early," Pablo said miserably. " "He has taken something of thine," the woman said miserably.  Then," she finished miserably, "when he did not come I worried and when I worried I felt of the sacks to be sure all was well and there were the slit places and I came to thee"
4		shouldst			 "Thou shouldst eat," she said and let her hand rest there.  "Thou shouldst be the professor in place of the Ingl�s.  "Then," Pilar went on, "it is important that the day be in autumn with rain, or at least some fog, or early winter even and now thou shouldst continue to walk through the city and down the Calle de Salud smelling what thou wilt smell where they are sweeping out the casas de putas and emptying the siop jars into the drains and, with this odor of love's labor lost mixed sweetly with soapy water and cigarette butts only faintly reaching thy nostrils, thou shouldst go on to the JardIn Bot�nico where at night those girls who can no longer work in the houses do their work against the iron gates of the park and the iron picketed fences and upon the sidewalks
4		manners			" "The people had no manners and I could not understand them.  It wasn't just manners that they had.  "But he has a wonderful face and his face and his manners are very successful
4		oxen			 "We went to the beach and lay in the water and boats with sails were hauled up out of the sea by oxen.  The oxen driven to the water until they must swim; then harnessed to the boats, and, when they found their feet, staggering up the sand.  Ten yokes of oxen dragging a boat with sails out of the sea in the morning with the line of the small waves breaking on the beach

4		waken			 "We made love and then sent for another pitcher of beer with the drops of its coldness on the glass and when the girl brought it, I took it from the door and I placed the coldness of the pitcher against the back of Finito as he lay, now, asleep, not having wakened when the beer was brought, and he said, `No, Pilar.  "Maria," he said, and shook the girl's shoulder to waken her.  He heard her breathing steadily and regularly now and he knew she was asleep and he lay awake and very still not wanting to waken her by moving
4		befoul			 "Then go and befoul thyself," Pilar said to him without heat.  I befoul myself in the milk of the springtime".  "Go and befoul them," Agust�n said
4		thresh			 "We had won the town and it was still early in the morning and no one had eaten nor had any one drunk coffee and we looked at each other and we were all powdered with dust from the blowing up of the barracks, as powdered as men are at a threshing, and I stood holding the pistol and it was heavy in my hand and I felt weak in the stomach when I looked at the guards dead there against the wall; they all as gray and as dusty as we were, but each one was now moistening with his blood the dry dirt by the wall where they lay.  We have harvested but we have not threshed. ' "`We thresh fascists today,' said one, `and out of the chaff comes the freedom of this pueblo
4		bullfight			 For an amateur bullfight.  It was the same impulse that had made him announce himself for the bullfight.  Never have I seen a man with more fear before the bullfight and never have I seen a man with less fear in the ring
4		sickle			 Some had sickles and reaping hooks but these Pablo placed at the far end where the lines reached the edge of the cliff. ' "So they clubbed him to death very quickly because of the insult, beating him as soon as he reached the first of the men, beating him as he tried to walk with his head up, beating him until he fell and chopping at him with reaping hooks and the sickles, and many men bore him to the edge of the cliff to throw him over and there was blood now on their hands and on their clothing, and now began to be the feeling that these who came out were truly enemies and should be killed.  And I saw the priest with his skirts tucked up scrambling over a bench and those after him were chopping at him with the sickles and the reaping hooks and then some one had hold of his robe and there was another scream and another scream and I saw two men chopping into his back with sickles while a third man held the skirt of his robe and the Priest's arms were up and he was clinging to the back of a chair and then the chair I was standing on broke and the drunkard and I were on the pavement that smelled of spilled wine and vomit and the drunkard was shaking his finger at me and saying, `No hay derecho, mujer, no hay derecho
4		hoarse			' His voice was hoarse from shouting in the assault and from the smoke of the barracks.  "`Listen, you,' Pablo said to the priest in his hoarse voice, `who goes now. ' until he was hoarse
4		underhand			' "And as we were at the far end of the line where the walk runs along the cliff by the river, he took the hat in his hand and sailed it off over the cliff with the motion a herdsman makes throwing a stone underhand at the bulls to herd them. ' "And as we were at the far end of the line where the walk runs along the cliff by the river, he took the hat in his hand and sailed it off over the cliff with the motion a herdsman makes throwing a stone underhand at the bulls to herd them.  Then Pablo leaned forward, picked up the key and tossed it underhand to the guard at the door
4		pajama			 It was Don Jos� Castro, whom every one called Don Pepe, a confirmed fascist, and a dealer in horses, and he stood up now small, neat-looking even unshaven and wearing a pajama top tucked into a pair of gray-striped trousers.  Not time, not happiness, not fun, not children, not a house, not a bathroom, not a clean pair of pajamas, not the morning paper, not to wake up together, not to wake and know she's there and that you're not alone.  I will buy thee various nightgowns and pajamas too if you should prefer them"
4		heaving			' And in that moment, looking through the bars, I saw the hail full of men flailing away with clubs and striking with flails, and poking and striking and pushing and heaving against people with the white wooden pitchforks "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 70 that now were red and with their tines broken, and this was going on all over the room while Pablo sat in the big chair with his shotgun on his knees, watching, and they were shouting and clubbing and stabbing and men were screaming as horses scream in a fire.  He would bring that head down with the sweep his left arm would make with the wet, heavy cloth; but now he rocked back a little on his heels and sighted along the blade, profiled in front of the splintered horn; the bull's chest heaving and his eyes watching the cloth.  But he had had no choice except this hill and he had picked it as far away as he could see it and galloped for it, the automatic rifle heavy on his back, the horse laboring, barrel heaving between his thighs, the sack of grenades swinging against one side, the sack of automatic rifle pans banging against the other, and Joaqu�n and Ignacio halting and firing, halting and firing to give him time to get the gun in place
4		reproach			 You do not reproach me.  You do not reproach me.  "Do not reproach him"
4		breeches			 He was clean shaven and he walked toward them from the mouth of the cave, moving with the bow-legged walk that went with his cattle herdsman's breeches and boots.  Wearing black riding boots, gray breeches, and a gray tunic, with tiny hands and feet, puffily fragile of face and body, with a spitting way of talking through his bad teeth, he looked comic when Robert Jordan first saw him.  A car pulled up under the porte-cochere of the hotel, its headlights painted over with blue calcimine and a little man in black riding boots, gray riding breeches and a short, gray high-buttoned jacket stepped out and returned the salute of the two sentries as he opened the door, nodded to the secret policeman who sat at the concierge's desk and stepped into the elevator

4		raro			" "Algo raro," the deaf man nodded and his eyes went over Robert Jordan's face in a way that reminded him of the round opening at the end of the wand of a vacuum cleaner.  "Si, algo raro, pero bueno".  "Pues es muy raro
4		sheepskin			 Through the meal he had never unbuttoned his sheepskin coat and he had been carefully polite, careful to turn his head to hear and had returned to speaking his broken Spanish, asking Robert Jordan about conditions in the Republic politely; but it was obvious he wanted to be rid of them.  Maria brought him a sheepskin and put it on the dirt floor of the cave.  The sheepskin was fresh dried and not tanned and as Robert Jordan rested his stocking feet on it he could feel it crackle like parchment
4		squadron			 But if they did not do it two squadrons of cavalry would come and hunt them out of these hills in a week. " "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway161 "A patrol and part of a squadron".  "It was a squadron of cavalry
4		chicken-crut			 And then, on a lousy show like this, co-ordinating two chicken-crut guerilla bands to help you blow a bridge under impossible conditions, to abort a counteroffensive that will probably already be started, "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 93 you run into a girl like this Maria.  Robert Jordan was thinking, if I did not have to work with this woman and her drunken man and her chicken-crut outfit, I would slap her so hard across the face that.  "I do not believe in ogres, soothsayers, fortune tellers, or chicken-crut gypsy witchcraft"
4		clink			 Robert Jordan looked him in the eyes and clinked his cup.  I'd like to clink this cup against your teeth.  I'd like to clink this cup against your teeth
4		los			 I was at the table and others were there, Pastora, who is uglier than I am, and the Nina de los Peines, and other gypsies and whores of great category.  "I was enjoying myself to such an extent and I was so busy clapping my hands to the playing of Ricardo and aiding to make up a team to clap for the singing of the Nina de los Peines that I did not notice that Finito had filled his own napkin by now, and that he had taken mine.  "La cueva de los huevos perdidos," Robert Jordan capped the other happily
4		penance			 I think that after the war there will have to be some great penance done for the killing.  If we no longer have religion after the war then I think there must be some form of civic penance organized that all may be cleansed from the killing or else we will never have a true and human basis for living.  The killing is necessary, I know, but still the doing of it is very bad for a man and I think that, after all this is over and we have won the war, there must be a penance of some kind for the cleansing of us all
4		atone			 But I think any one doing it will be brutalized in time and I think that even though necessary, it is a great sin and that afterwards we must do something very strong to atone for it.  But surely there will be an opportunity to atone for that because for a sin of that sort that so many bear, certainly some just relief will be devised.  All the other things are forgiven or one had a chance to atone for them by kindness or in some decent way
4		negro			 "What is the matter, negro.  "What is the matter, negro. " "Watch your mouth about calling me negro"
4		contemptuously			 Agust�n stood there looking down at him and cursed him, speaking slowly, clearly, bitterly and contemptuously and cursing as steadily as though he were dumping manure on a field, lifting it with a dung fork out of a wagon.  He moved reluctantly and contemptuously. " Primitivo said contemptuously now
4		saddlebag			 The gypsy, Rafael, was coming toward them through the rocks, carrying a pair of cloth saddlebags, his rifle slung on his back.  "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway210 "In those saddlebags".  Then they were untying the halters and Robert Jordan had given the automatic rifle back to Agust�n and slung his own submachine gun over his back, and he was putting bombs out of his pockets into the saddlebags, and he stuffed one empty pack inside the other and tied that one behind his saddle
4		spurt			 Then he took another big mouthful of wine, lifting the bag up to let the jet of wine spurt into the back of his mouth, the wineskin touching the needles of the blind of pine branches that covered the automatic rifle as he lifted his hand, his head leaning against the pine branches as he bent it back to let the wine run down.  Then he took another big mouthful of wine, lifting the bag up to let the jet of wine spurt into the back of his mouth, the wineskin touching the needles of the blind of pine branches that covered the automatic rifle as he lifted his hand, his head leaning against the pine branches as he bent it back to let the wine run down. " Andr�s would be ashamed, empty-feeling, proud and happy, and he would shake them all off and wash his hands and his right arm and wash his knife well and then take one of the wineskins and rinse the ear-taste out of his mouth for that year; spitting the wine on the stone flags of the plaza before he lifted the wineskin high and let the wine spurt into the back of his mouth
4		twitching			 The rest of his face was flat brown with a broken, flattened nose and deep-set gray eyes, and watching him Robert Jordan saw the stubble twitching at the corners of his mouth and over the cord of his throat.  "Oh, obscenity them," Primitivo said with an absolute devoutness of blasphemy, tears in his eyes and his cheeks twitching.  He looked forward with excitement, delight and sweating fear to the moment when, in the square, he would hear the clatter of the bull's horns knocking against the wood of his travelling box, and then the sight of him as he came, sliding, braking out into the square, his head up, his nostrils wide, his ears twitching, dust in the sheen of his "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway196 black hide, dried crut splashed on his flanks, watching his eyes set wide apart, unblinking eyes under the widespread horns as smooth and solid as driftwood polished by the sand, the sharp tips uptilted so that to see them did something to your heart
4		farthest			 He thought he saw something that he was looking for but it was a hawk that slid down into the wind and then rose above the line of the farthest pine woods.  He thought he saw something that he was looking for but it was a hawk that slid down into the wind and then rose above the line of the farthest pine woods.  In the yellow flash and gray roar of smoke he had seen the officer dive forward to where he lay now like a heavy, broken bundle of old clothing marking the farthest point that the assault had reached
4		bridle			 There had still been snow then, the snow that had ruined them, and when his horse was hit so that he wheezed in a slow, jerking, climbing stagger up the last part of the crest, splattering the snow with a bright, pulsing jet, Sordo had hauled him along by the bridle, the reins over his shoulder as he climbed.  There had still been snow then, the snow that had ruined them, and when his horse was hit so that he wheezed in a slow, jerking, climbing stagger up the last part of the crest, splattering the snow with a bright, pulsing jet, Sordo had hauled him along by the bridle, the reins over his shoulder as he climbed.  Robert Jordan heard the creaking and the heavy breathing as they all dismounted and the clinking of a bridle as a horse tossed his head
4		caza			 But from his manner of speaking he is caza mayor.  I said he was caza mayor.  As he ran he heard Agust�n shouting, "Buena caza, Ingl�s
4		barbershop			 We were tied by the wrists in a long line of girls and women and they herded us up by the hill and through the streets to the square and in the square they stopped in front of the barbershop which was across the square from the city hail. ' "Then they cut the rope that was on each of my wrists, one saying to others of them, `Tie up the line,' and these two took me by the arms and into the barbershop and lifted me up and put me in the barber's chair and held me there.  "I saw my face in the mirror of the barbershop and the faces of those who were holding me and the faces of three others who were leaning over me and I knew none of their faces but in the glass I saw myself and them, but they saw only me
4		clipper			 "Then the one who had gagged me ran a clippers all over my head; first from the forehead all the way to the back of the neck and then across the top and then all over my head and close behind my ears and they held me so I could see into the glass of the barber's mirror all the time that they did this and I could not believe it as I saw it done and I cried and I cried but I could not look away from the horror that my face made with the mouth open and the braids tied in it and my head coming naked under the clippers.

"And when the one with the clippers was finished he took a bottle of iodine from the shelf of the barber (they had shot the barber too for he belonged to a syndicate, and he lay in the doorway of the shop and they had lifted me over him as they brought me in) and with the glass wand that is in the iodine bottle he touched me on the ear where it had been cut and the small pain of that came through my grief and through my horror

4		reprieve			 He knew the reprieved feeling he had felt when the Ingl�s had told him he was to go with the message.  He had looked forward to that moment all the year when he was a boy; but the feeling when the Ingl�s gave the order about the message was the same as when you woke to hear the reprieve of the rain falling on the slate roof, against the stone wall and into the puddles on the dirt Street of the village.

4		whirr			 Just then, as knee deep in the gorse he climbed the steep slope that led to the Republican lines, a partridge flew up from under his feet, exploding in a whirr of wingbeats in the dark and he felt a sudden breath-stopping fright.  Just then, as knee deep in the gorse he climbed the steep slope that led to the Republican lines, a partridge flew up from under his feet, exploding in a whirr of wingbeats in the dark and he felt a sudden breath-stopping fright.  The little tank whirred backwards, scuttling out of sight and Robert Jordan picked up the automatic rifle, clamped the tripod against the barrel and swung the gun with its still hot muzzle over his shoulder
4		guerrillero			 "I am a guerrillero from the band of Pablo.  "I am no fascist but a guerrillero from the band of Pablo.  This commander, who was named "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway212 Gomez, cursed the company commander for his stupidity, patted Andr�s on the back, gave him a drink of bad brandy and told him that he himself, the ex-barber, had always wanted to be a guerrillero

4		whitewash			 Instead of sending Andr�s back to brigade headquarters with the motorcyclist, Gomez had decided to take him there himself in order to expedite things and, with Andr�s holding tight onto the seat ahead of him, they roared, bumping down the shell-pocked mountain road between the double row of big trees, the headlight of the motorcycle showing their whitewashed bases and the places on the trunks where the whitewash and the bark had been chipped and torn by shell fragments and bullets during the fighting along this road in the first summer of the movement.

Then, the horse tied again, she with the saddle up now, the blanket smoothed, hauling tight on the cinch she heard the big, deep voice from the timber below, "Maria
4		radiator			 The second truck had its radiator completely smashed in. " And as the motorcycle passed the high gray trucks full of troops, gray trucks with high square cabs and square ugly radiators, steadily mounting the road in the dust and the flicking lights of the pursuing staff car, the red star of the army showing in the light when it passed over the tail gates, showing when the light came onto the sides of the dusty truck bodies, as they passed, climbing steadily now, the air colder and the road starting to turn in bends and switchbacks now, the trucks laboring and grinding, some steaming in the light flashes, the motorcycle laboring now too, and Andr�s clinging tight to the front seat as they climbed, Andr�s thought this ride on a motorcycle was mucho, mucho.  Shoot me the top of the radiator

But he was not able to admit he was wrong that quickly and he said it anyway to delay the moment of humiliation, not accepting any humiliation.  He was wrong and there was nothing he could do about it now but he was not accepting any humiliation
4		clang			" and he thought, "Nice hunting, like hell, nice hunting," and just then he heard Anselmo shoot at the far end of the bridge, the noise of the shot clanging in the steel girders.  The bullets hit the road surface and sung off and now they were pinging and clanging in the iron of the bridge. " and felt his big horse's chest surging with the steepening of the slope and saw the gray neck stretching and the gray ears ahead and he reached and patted the wet gray neck, and he looked back at the bridge and saw the bright flash from the heavy, squat, mud-colored tank there on the road and then he did not hear any "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway246 whish but only a banging acrid smelling clang like a boiler being ripped apart and he was under the gray horse and the gray horse was kicking and he was trying to pull out from under the weight
4		groin			 He looked to be shot through the groin for he was holding himself there with both hands while the man and the boy held him on either side.  He looked to be shot through the groin for he was holding himself there with both hands while the man and the boy held him on either side.  He held both hands against his groin now and put his head back against the bank, his legs straight out before him
4		halter			 Then the bridge blew and one horse snapped his halter when he rose and jerked his head at the cracking roar and he went off through the trees.  Then the bridge blew and one horse snapped his halter when he rose and jerked his head at the cracking roar and he went off through the trees.  Then they were untying the halters and Robert Jordan had given the automatic rifle back to Agust�n and slung his own submachine gun over his back, and he was putting bombs out of his pockets into the saddlebags, and he stuffed one empty pack inside the other and tied that one behind his saddle
4		turret			 It was then he saw the low-bodied, angled snout and squat green, gray and brown-splashed turret with the projecting machine gun come around the bend into the bright sun.  Watching the corner, Robert Jordan saw the nose just reappear, then the edge of the turret showed and the turret swung so that the gun was pointing down the road.  Watching the corner, Robert Jordan saw the nose just reappear, then the edge of the turret showed and the turret swung so that the gun was pointing down the road
3		steepness			 He was sweating heavily and his thigh muscles were twitchy from the steepness of the climb.  And what an obscenity of steepness it is to arrive here".  See how that steepness guards thy flank
3		grinning			" "Hotze," said Golz grinning, making the sound deep in his throat as though hawking with a bad cold.  He was walking with a loose, high-hipped, sloppy swing, his carbine was slung on his back, his brown face was grinning and he carried two big hares, one in each hand.  He could not help grinning at the gypsy
3		tanned			 That was the last he had seen of Golz with his strange white face that never tanned, his hawk eyes, the big nose and thin lips and the shaven head crossed with wrinkles and with scars.  So he thought about the girl Maria, with her skin, the hair and the eyes all the same golden tawny brown, the hair a little darker than the rest but it would be lighter as her skin tanned deeper, the smooth skin, pale gold on the surface with a darkness underneath.  The sheepskin was fresh dried and not tanned and as Robert Jordan rested his stocking feet on it he could feel it crackle like parchment
3		machine-gun			 Tomorrow night they would be outside the Escorial in the dark along the road; the long lines of trucks loading the infantry in the darkness; the men, heavy loaded, climbing up into the trucks; the machine-gun sections lifting their guns into the trucks; the tanks being run up on the skids onto the long-bodied tank trucks; pulling the Division out to move them in the night for the attack on the pass.  Then the planes machine-gunned the hilltop and went away.  They have been forced to quell the mutinies with automatic rifle and machine-gun fire
3		bareheaded			 This man was bareheaded.  I looked back over the square and at all the windows and all the balconies there were people crowded and there was the double line of men across the square to the doorway of the Ayuntamiento and the crowd swarmed Outside against the windows of that building and there was the noise of many people talking, and then I heard a shout and some one said `Here comes the first one,' and it was Don Benito Garcia, the Mayor, and he came out bareheaded walking slowly from the door and down the porch and nothing happened; and he walked between the line of men with the flails and nothing happened.  He had on a long overcoat and he was bareheaded and his hair was gray, his cheekbones broad and his eyes were deep and set close together
3		rim-rock			 2 They had come through the heavy timber to the cup-shaped upper end of the little valley and he saw where the camp must be under the rim-rock that rose ahead of them through the trees.  There was a large cave in the rim-rock formation and beside the opening a man sat with his back against the rock, his legs stretched out on the ground and his carbine leaning against the rock.  11 As they came up, still deep in the shadow of the pines, after dropping down from the high meadow into the wooden valley and climbing up it on a trail that paralleled the stream and then left it to gain, steeply, the top of a rim-rock formation, a man with a carbine stepped out from behind a tree
3		unsling			 Anselmo lowered his pack, too, and Robert Jordan unslung the rifle and leaned it against the rock.  Then I saw Pablo unsling his shotgun and he reached over and tapped the priest on the shoulder with it.  Andr�s unslung it and handed it to him
3		thumbnail			 He ran his thumbnail around the edge of the box and, opening the lid, handed them to Pablo who took half a dozen.  He ran his thumbnail along the side of the paper box with the big colored figure of a warship on the cover and pushed the box toward Pablo. " Robert Jordan held the graypainted grenade in his hand, trying the bend of the cotter pin with his thumbnail
3		resinous			 The wine was good, tasting faintly resinous from the wineskin, but excellent, light and clean on his tongue.  He smelled the odor of the pine boughs under him, the piney smell of the crushed needles and the sharper odor of the resinous sap from the cut limbs.  Walking carefully, downhill, Anselmo in the lead, Agust�n next, Robert Jordan placing his feet carefully so that he would not slip, feeling the dead pine needles under his rope- soled shoes, bumping a tree root with one foot and putting a hand forward and feeling the cold metal jut of the automatic rifle barrel and the folded legs of the tripod, then working sideways down the hill, his shoes sliding and grooving the forest floor, putting his left hand out again and touching the rough bark of a tree trunk, then as he braced himself his hand feeling a smooth place, the base of the palm of his hand coming away sticky from the resinous sap where a blaze had been cut, they dropped down the steep wooded hillside to the point above the bridge where Robert Jordan and Anselmo had watched the first day
3		jumpy			 He must have been jumpy even then, Robert Jordan thought.  I wish I would have known he was that jumpy as far back as then.  You will kill off Pilar, Anselmo, Agust�n, Primitivo, this jumpy Eladio, the worthless gypsy and old Fernando, and you won't get your bridge blown
3		stooped			 The girl stooped as she came out of the cave mouth carrying the big iron cooking platter and Robert Jordan saw her face turned at an angle and at the same time saw the strange thing about her.  He laid one pack down and lifted the blanket aside, "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 28 then with his head stooped and with a pack in each hand, carrying by the leather shoulder straps, he went into the cave.  As he passed he "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway234 stooped down and picked up the submachine gun and slung it over his shoulder again
3		tine			 The girl had leaned four forks, tines down, against the sides of the iron dish.  And those who did not have flails had heavy herdsman's clubs, or ox-goads, and some had wooden pitchforks; those with wooden tines that are used to fork the chaff and straw into the air after the flailing. ' And in that moment, looking through the bars, I saw the hail full of men flailing away with clubs and striking with flails, and poking and striking and pushing and heaving against people with the white wooden pitchforks "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 70 that now were red and with their tines broken, and this was going on all over the room while Pablo sat in the big chair with his shotgun on his knees, watching, and they were shouting and clubbing and stabbing and men were screaming as horses scream in a fire
3		colt			 She moved awkwardly as a colt moves, but with that same grace as of a young animal.  Thou art no colt of a girl with cropped head and the movement of a foal still wet from its mother.  She walks like a colt moves, he thought
3		surety			 "They only know now there is a war and people may kill again as in the olden times without a surety of punishment".  To be bigoted you have to be absolutely sure that you are right and nothing makes that surety and righteousness like continence.  Instead of the surety of failure he felt confidence rising in him as a tire begins to fill with air from a slow pump
3		exterminate			 "You cannot exterminate them because from their seed comes more with greater hatred.  "I understand your needs and I know the posts must be exterminated and the bridge covered while you do your work.  "It is necessary to exterminate the post at the sawmill"
3		obscenely			" "That we blow up an obscene bridge and then have to obscenely well obscenity ourselves off out of these mountains.  The man, Agust�n, spoke so obscenely, coupling an obscenity to every noun as an adjective, using the same obscenity as a verb, that Robert Jordan wondered if he could speak a straight sentence.  Kashkin had made him out to be a hell of a fellow and Karkov had at first been insultingly polite and then, when Robert Jordan had not played at being a hero but had told a story that was really funny and obscenely discreditable to himself, Karkov had shifted from the politeness to a relieved rudeness and then to insolence and they had become friends
3		lard			 "If it is not unprintable," naming the principal obscenity that had larded the conversation.  "There's a tub of lard on the ribs of each one.  "There's a tub of lard on the ribs of each one
3		equipped			 "From people less unprintably equipped than I".  "In order to support and aid those men poorly equipped for procreation," Pilar said, "if there is nothing to see I am going".  Surely they would have equipped him with those
3		rawhide-covered			 Anselmo brought him a rawhide-covered stool and he sat down at the table.  Of the others, who were laying out blankets and bedrolls on the floor in front of the cooking fire, pushing back the slab tables and the rawhide-covered stools to make sleeping space, Primitivo and Andr�s looked up and said, "Buenas noches".  He moved from the wall to the table and began filling his pockets with grenades from one of the rawhide-covered panniers that leaned, open, against the table leg
3		cafs			 There was very little of it left and one cup of it took the place of the evening papers, of all the old evenings in caf�s, of all chestnut trees that would be in bloom now in this month, of the great slow horses of the outer boulevards, of book shops, of kiosques, and of galleries, of the Parc Montsouris, of the Stade Buffalo, and of the Butte Chaumont, of the Guaranty Trust Company and the Ile de la Cite, of Foyot's old hotel, and of being able to read and relax in the evening; of all the things he had enjoyed and forgotten and that came back to him when he tasted that opaque, bitter, tongue-numbing, brain-warming, stomach-warming, idea-changing liquid alchemy.  The officers speak in the caf�s in Segovia and Avila and the waiters note it.  Never have I seen caf�s so crowded
3		cowardly			 It is not cowardly to know what is foolish".  "Neither is it foolish to know what is cowardly," said Anselmo, unable to resist making the phrase.  The cowardly swine
3		pitifully			" he said almost pitifully.  Then as a last thing pitifully and hopefully.  "I don't want to hear it," Maria said pitifully
3		buttocks			 Then having killed him exactly as I should and him absolutely dead, swaying on his legs, and ready to fall of his own weight, I walked away from him with a certain amount of arrogance and much style and from the back he throws me this horn between the cheeks of my buttocks and it comes out of my liver".  "Yes, but hard on the buttocks.  "His nose was flat as my hand and he had cheekbones as wide as a sheep's buttocks"
3		buttock			 Then having killed him exactly as I should and him absolutely dead, swaying on his legs, and ready to fall of his own weight, I walked away from him with a certain amount of arrogance and much style and from the back he throws me this horn between the cheeks of my buttocks and it comes out of my liver".  "Yes, but hard on the buttocks.  "His nose was flat as my hand and he had cheekbones as wide as a sheep's buttocks"
3		sullen			 "A cup of water for me," Robert Jordan said, not taking his eyes from the man with his sullen heavy head and the woman standing proudly and confidently holding the big spoon as authoritatively as though it were a baton.  They had both gotten sullen as he talked.  Primitivo was still sullen
3		flat-faced			 "Look how it seems," the flat-faced man, who was named Primitivo, said.  "Don't let him get started again, Ingl�s," the flat-faced man with the broken nose who was called Primitivo said. " Pilar said to the flat-faced man
3		didst			 "Why didst thou not kill Pablo.  After what thou didst last night.  Just before thou didst the bridge"
3		starlight			 They could see his heavy, long-armed body in the starlight.  Looking across it in the darkness, lighter here in the open from the starlight, he saw the dark bulks of the picketed horses.  As his eyes became used to the starlight he could see that Pablo was standing by one of the horses
3		grazing			 The horse lifted his head from grazing; then dropped it impatiently.  The horse understood nothing that he said; only, from the tone of the voice, that they were endearments and he had been in the corral all day and was hungry now, grazing impatiently at the limits of his picket rope, and the man annoyed him.  The horse went on grazing and was relieved now that the man did not bother him
3		arching			 Thou with the big neck arching like the viaduct of my pueblo," he stopped.  "But arching more and much finer".  Primitivo brought the pine branches and Robert Jordan stuck them through the snow into the unfrozen earth, arching them over the gun from either side
3		finer			 "But arching more and much finer".  He had a letter in his things in the trunk at Missoula from General Phil Sheridan to old Killy-the-Horse Kilpatrick that said his grandfather was a finer leader of irregular cavalry than John Mosby.  There is no finer and no worse people in the world
3		pus			 The old flag of yellow and gold we called pus and blood.  The flag of the Republic with the purple added we call blood, pus and permanganate.  This hill is truly like a chancre, Sordo thought, and we are the very pus of it

3		fascism			" "Since I have understood fascism".  But we can educate the people so that they will fear fascism and recognize it as it appears and combat it".  "To obscenity with all fascism good
3		one-elevens			 These three were Heinkel one-elevens, twin-motor bombers.  Then came a new and louder droning roar and three more Heinkel one-elevens showed coming steeply, stiffly, lower yet, crossing in rigid formation, their pounding roar approaching in crescendo to an absolute of noise and then receding as they passed the clearing.  Two hundred and fifty miles an hour for those one-elevens anyway
3		crescendo			 Then came a new and louder droning roar and three more Heinkel one-elevens showed coming steeply, stiffly, lower yet, crossing in rigid formation, their pounding roar approaching in crescendo to an absolute of noise and then receding as they passed the clearing.

3		admiringly			 "What a watch," Rafael said admiringly.  She looked at the pinch-bottle admiringly.  "Thus one talks," Agust�n said admiringly, but absent-mindedly
3		crayfish			 Then we ate paella with fresh sea food, clams in their shells, mussels, crayfish, and small eels.  If there was no war I would go with Eladio to get crayfish from that stream back there by the fascist post.  If we go to the Sierra de Gredos after this of the bridge there are fine streams there for trout and for crayfish also
3		coldness			 Also the beer in pitchers all through the afternoon, the beer sweating in its coldness in pitchers the size of water jugs".  "We made love and then sent for another pitcher of beer with the drops of its coldness on the glass and when the girl brought it, I took it from the door and I placed the coldness of the pitcher against the back of Finito as he lay, now, asleep, not having wakened when the beer was brought, and he said, `No, Pilar.  "We made love and then sent for another pitcher of beer with the drops of its coldness on the glass and when the girl brought it, I took it from the door and I placed the coldness of the pitcher against the back of Finito as he lay, now, asleep, not having wakened when the beer was brought, and he said, `No, Pilar
3		firecracker			 We made love there, the room dark in the day time from the hanging blinds, and from the streets there was the scent of the flower market and the smell of burned powder from the firecrackers of the traca that ran though the streets exploding each noon during the Feria.  It was a line of fireworks that ran through all the city, the firecrackers linked together and the explosions running along on poles and wires of the tramways, exploding with great noise and a jumping from pole to pole with a sharpness and a cracking of explosion you could not believe.  It sounded as though pack after pack of miniature firecrackers were going off at a distance that was almost out of hearing
3		sloth			 That remains of all the laziness, sloth and failure.  They have settled happily into the sloth and bureaucracy of governing.  Then by the sloth of a bureaucratic fascist
3		civilized			 It is the only civilized thing we have.  She is a damned sight more civilized than you are and she knows what time is all about.  "I had always considered America a civilized country"
3		rubbing			 He reached out and found Maria's hand and held it in his, rubbing their two hands against the heather until she opened her hand and laid it flat on top of his as they listened.  She saw the eyes closed and the solemn brown face and the curly black hair pushed back now from the forehead and she was sitting by him on the bed rubbing the legs, chafing the taut muscles of the calves, kneading them, loosening them, and then tapping them lightly with her folded hands, loosening the cramped muscles.  As he crouched, rubbing his feet, he heard a motorcar on the road
3		hooks			 Some had sickles and reaping hooks but these Pablo placed at the far end where the lines reached the edge of the cliff. ' "So they clubbed him to death very quickly because of the insult, beating him as soon as he reached the first of the men, beating him as he tried to walk with his head up, beating him until he fell and chopping at him with reaping hooks and the sickles, and many men bore him to the edge of the cliff to throw him over and there was blood now on their hands and on their clothing, and now began to be the feeling that these who came out were truly enemies and should be killed.  And I saw the priest with his skirts tucked up scrambling over a bench and those after him were chopping at him with the sickles and the reaping hooks and then some one had hold of his robe and there was another scream and another scream and I saw two men chopping into his back with sickles while a third man held the skirt of his robe and the Priest's arms were up and he was clinging to the back of a chair and then the chair I was standing on broke and the drunkard and I were on the pavement that smelled of spilled wine and vomit and the drunkard was shaking his finger at me and saying, `No hay derecho, mujer, no hay derecho
3		barrels			 He was barefooted as when he had been taken from his home and he walked ahead of Pablo holding his hands above his head, and Pablo walked behind him with the barrels of his shotgun pressing against the back of Don Federico Gonzalez until Don Federico entered the double line.  Those on rubber tires with the long barrels.  In each of them there was such a gun with pine branches spread across the barrels
3		crucifix			' The priest blessed him as he spoke and blessed him again as he stood up, without interrupting his praying, and held up a crucifix for Don Ricardo to kiss and Don Ricardo kissed it and then turned and said to Pablo, `Nor ever again as ready.  They were still praying as they had been, the men all kneeling, with their shirts open, some with their heads down, others with their heads up, looking toward the priest and toward the crucifix that he held, and the priest praying fast and hard and looking Out over their heads, and in back of them Pablo, with his cigarette now lighted, was sitting there on the table swinging his legs, his shotgun slung over his back, and he was playing with the key.  He kissed the crucifix and the priest blessed him and he stood up and looked at Pablo and jerked his head toward the door
3		bota			 Those who did not drink from the bottles of liquor were drinking from leather wineskins that were passed about and one handed a wineskin to me and I took a long drink, letting the wine run cool down my throat from the leather bota for I was very thirsty, too.  Give me the bota with wine, Pilar".  But give me the bota
3		undoubtedly			 He had a rude way of speaking and he was undoubtedly a fascist and a member of their club and he sat at noon and at evening in the cane chairs of their club to read El Debate, to have his shoes shined, and to drink vermouth and seltzer and eat roasted almonds, dried shrimps, and anchovies.  "He would undoubtedly have seen many evil things," Fernando said.  But undoubtedly they must have sent for a mortar too
3		disassociate			 But after Don Guillermo I felt a feeling of shame and distaste, and with the coming of the drunkards and the worthless ones into the lines, and the abstention of those who left the lines as a protest after Don Guillermo, I wished that I might disassociate myself altogether from the lines, and I walked away, across the square, and sat down on a bench under one of the big trees that gave shade there.  "One moment you are drunk and putting your mouth on all of us and disassociating yourself from the work in hand and speaking of our death in a dirty manner and insulting the women and opposing that which should be done" "I was drunk," Pablo told him.  As they crouched now behind the boulder watching the captain and listening to what he was shouting, they both disassociated themselves from him and what he was saying
3		lug			' "`Why should we lug that tub of tripe to the cliff. ' "`Why should we lug that tub of tripe to the cliff.  They used to yell that at football when you lugged the ball
3		derecho			 `No hay derecho, mujer.  And I saw the priest with his skirts tucked up scrambling over a bench and those after him were chopping at him with the sickles and the reaping hooks and then some one had hold of his robe and there was another scream and another scream and I saw two men chopping into his back with sickles while a third man held the skirt of his robe and the Priest's arms were up and he was clinging to the back of a chair and then the chair I was standing on broke and the drunkard and I were on the pavement that smelled of spilled wine and vomit and the drunkard was shaking his finger at me and saying, `No hay derecho, mujer, no hay derecho.

3		feria			 In September at the feria".  One time at the feria of Valladolid he killed a bull of Pablo Romero very well" "I remember," the first brother said.  I've probably seen him run through the streets ahead of the bulls at the feria in Pamplona, Robert Jordan thought
3		earthenware			 The bottle was under one arm, and three glasses were in the hand of that arm, a finger in each glass, and his other hand was around the neck of an earthenware jar of water.  Robert Jordan poured a big drink of Scotch into the glass and El Sordo watched him eagerly and when he had finished, handed him the water jug and Robert Jordan filled the glass with the cold water that ran in a stream from the earthenware spout as he tipped up the jug.  After they went out he went to a cabinet, took out a glass and a bottle, and poured himself some whiskey and poured plain water into it from an earthenware crock that stood on the floor against the wall
3		gravedad			 "Dentro de la gravedad," he said in Spanish.  "Dentro de la gravedad".  "Dentro de la gravedad"
3		pidgin			 So he does only speak that pidgin Spanish for foreigners, Robert Jordan thought.  He was not talking the pidgin Spanish now and he was looking into Robert Jordan's eyes calmly and explainingly; not searchingly nor suspiciously, nor with the flat superiority of the old campaigner that had been in them before.  And that poor bloody Sordo abandoning his pidgin Spanish to explain it to him so carefully
3		crut			 And I suppose that you'll go to Valencia together and we can eat goat crut in Gredos".  He looked forward with excitement, delight and sweating fear to the moment when, in the square, he would hear the clatter of the bull's horns knocking against the wood of his travelling box, and then the sight of him as he came, sliding, braking out into the square, his head up, his nostrils wide, his ears twitching, dust in the sheen of his "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway196 black hide, dried crut splashed on his flanks, watching his eyes set wide apart, unblinking eyes under the widespread horns as smooth and solid as driftwood polished by the sand, the sharp tips uptilted so that to see them did something to your heart.  The dirty rotten crut
3		wooded			 Neither Robert Jordan nor Maria spoke and the three of them travelled along fast until the trail rose steeply out of the wooded valley to come up through the timber, leave it, and come out into the high meadow.  Walking carefully, downhill, Anselmo in the lead, Agust�n next, Robert Jordan placing his feet carefully so that he would not slip, feeling the dead pine needles under his rope- soled shoes, bumping a tree root with one foot and putting a hand forward and feeling the cold metal jut of the automatic rifle barrel and the folded legs of the tripod, then working sideways down the hill, his shoes sliding and grooving the forest floor, putting his left hand out again and touching the rough bark of a tree trunk, then as he braced himself his hand feeling a smooth place, the base of the palm of his hand coming away sticky from the resinous sap where a blaze had been cut, they dropped down the steep wooded hillside to the point above the bridge where Robert Jordan and Anselmo had watched the first day.  With the sun just starting to come through the high branches of the pine trees, Gomez and Andr�s followed the chauffeur, whose name was Vicente, through the pines across the road and up the slope to the entrance of a dugout from the roof of which signal wires ran on up over the wooded slope
3		sallow			 He thought her brown face looked pallid and the skin sallow and that there were dark areas under her eyes.  He thought her brown face looked pallid and the skin sallow and that there were dark areas under her eyes.  He thought her brown face looked pallid and the skin sallow and that there were dark areas under her eyes
3		perspiration			 She started on up the trail but at the top she was breathing heavily and her face was wet with perspiration and there was no doubt about her pallor now.  But Robert Jordan noticed there were small drops of perspiration on her forehead and her lips.  There was perspiration on her forehead and she shook her head: She had been holding her lower lip between her teeth
3		wedged			 He placed the charges, wedged and lashed them, sunk his caps and crimped them, ran his wires, hooked them up and got back to where he had placed the old box of the exploder and then he started to think of all the things that could have happened and that might go wrong.  The dead man was heavy and so stiff you could not bend him and he had to hammer at his head to get it out from where it had wedged, face down, between his seat and the wheel.  The horn entirely destroyed the cranium, the head of Manolo being wedged under the estribo at the base of the barrera where the bull had tossed him"
3		guerra			 War, guerre, guerra, and krieg.  "Qu� cosa m�s mala es la guerra," he said to himself, which meant, "What a bad thing war is".  "Qu� puta es Ia guerra," Agust�n said
3		volition			 "Tell me one thing of thy own volition".  Tell me now of thy own volition".  "Now and of thy own volition
3		bleary			 His voice was thick and his eyes were red and bleary. " Robert Jordan swore and Pablo looked at him through his bleary eyes and laughed.  His eyes were bleary again
3		mi			" "A mi qu�.  "Ay, mi madre.  "My mother standing against the same wall said, `Viva my husband who was the Mayor of this village,' and I hoped they would shoot me too and I was going to say `Viva la Republica y vivan mis padres,' but instead there was no shooting but instead the doing of the things
3		pig-eyes			" "Yes" (damn your bloody, red pig-eyes and your swine-bristly swines-end of a face).  Good old pig-eyes doesn't know why I paid the Woods boys sixty-five dollars for that robe.  There was no expression on his face and his small pig-eyes were looking at the wine bowl as though he had never seen one before
3		thrusting			 She saw him stand, now, facing the five-year-old bull, facing the horns that had lifted the horses high, the great neck thrusting the horse up, up, as that rider poked into that neck with the spiked pole, thrusting up and up until the horse went over with a crash and the rider fell against the wooden fence and, with the bull's legs thrusting him forward, the big neck swung the horns that searched the horse for the life that was in him.

3		hilarity			 There was great hilarity by this time at the banquet and the noise was tremendous. ' "I did not think it was wise of him to drink, since he had eaten nothing, and since he had such a condition of the stomach; but he was evidently unable to support the merriment and the hilarity and the noise longer without taking something. ' He looked around at the table and then he looked at the bull's head and said, `No,' once more and then he put his head down and he put his napkin up to his mouth and then he just sat there like that and said nothing and the banquet, which had started so well, and promised to mark an epoch in hilarity and good fellowship was not a success"
3		liquidate			 I made a fool of myself with him once tonight and I am perfectly willing to liquidate him.  "By any name so that such as thee are liquidated".  He was sorry for them as human beings if it should be necessary to liquidate them
3		thinning			 "It is thinning now and there are small, hard pellets.  Karkov went over to another man of about forty-eight, who was short, chunky, jovial- looking with pale blue eyes, thinning blond hair and a gay mouth under a bristly yellow moustache.  Then he was looking through the thinning trees and he saw the oiled dark of the road below and beyond it the green slope of the hillside
3		insolence			 But he had more brains and more inner dignity and outer insolence and humor than any man that he had ever known.  Kashkin had made him out to be a hell of a fellow and Karkov had at first been insultingly polite and then, when Robert Jordan had not played at being a hero but had told a story that was really funny and obscenely discreditable to himself, Karkov had shifted from the politeness to a relieved rudeness and then to insolence and they had become friends.  She was his wife and he said something to her in Russian that no one could hear and for a moment the insolence that had been in his eyes as he entered the room was gone
3		counterattack			 We had held along the road under the bombing from the planes and the shelling when they brought their artillery up and those who were left at the end of that day had counterattacked and driven them back.  Later, when they had tried to come down on the left, sifting down between the rocks and through the trees, we had held out in the Sanitarium firing from the windows and the roof although they had passed it on both sides, and we lived through knowing what it was to be surrounded until the counterattack had cleared them back behind the road again.

3		stiffening			" Robert Jordan had come to Madrid from the C�rdoban Front and he had the sudden stiffening that comes when some one jokes about a thing which you yourself may joke about but which they may not.  It was a cold day and the yellow dust was blowing down the street and Montero had been hit in the left arm and the arm was stiffening.  His head hurt very much and his arm was stiffening so that the pain of moving it was almost unbearable
3		dialectics			 How much dialectics have you read.  Don't ever kid yourself with too much dialectics.  "He is studying dialectics

3		apprehension			 "You saw fear and apprehension.  The apprehension was for the possibility of evil he imagined".  There was little difference at first, although there was a definite beginning, as when the pump starts and the rubber of the tube crawls a little, but it came now as steadily as a tide rising or the sap rising in a tree until he began to feel the first edge of that negation of apprehension that often turned into actual happiness before action
3		believest			 So he said to Pablo, "Thou, believest thou in this wizardry.  "Thou believest in this seriously. " "If thou believest so much in thy Pasionaria, get her to get us off this hill," one of the men who had a bandaged thigh said
3		reflex			 "Every one knew that Sanchez Mejias was on the road to a cornada because he had been too long out of training, because his style was heavy and dangerous, and because his strength and the agility in his legs were gone and his reflexes no longer as they had been".  It was as though a reflex lens camera had been suddenly brought into focus.  It was as though a reflex lens camera had been suddenly brought into focus
3		ignoble			 "It is ignoble".  "That way of speaking is ignoble," Anselmo said.  It would be ignoble of me not to participate in this action because of the accident of this message
3		undress			 Under his head, as he lay on his side, was the bulge of the trousers and the coat that he had wrapped around his shoes to make a pillow and against his side was the cold metal of the big automatic pistol he had taken from the holster when he undressed and fastened by its lanyard to his right wrist.  He did not bother to undress because at two o'clock he would be starting for the drive by Colmenar, Cerceda, and Navacerrada up to the front where Golz would be attacking in the morning.

3		spruce			 Earlier in the evening he had taken the ax and gone outside of the cave and walked through the new snow to the edge of the clearing and cut down a small spruce tree.

3		piles			 That must be the odor of nostalgia, the smell of the smoke from the piles of raked leaves burning in the streets in the fall in Missoula.  They had dug with their knees and hands and made mounds in front of their heads and shoulders with the dirt and piles of stones.  Those big piles of sawdust
3		documentation			 "Go then," Robert Jordan said, "and come quickly with the breakfast and bring to me the documentation of that requet�.  "Did you bring the documentation of the requet�.  "The documentation and the letters of that requet� we shot this morning

3		theirs			 Killing is something one must do, but ours are different from theirs.  "There is no always either with our munitions or theirs".  The way the planes are beautiful whether they are ours or theirs
3		glade			 The tops of the boulders were drying and as he climbed he looked across the country and saw the pine woods and the long open glade and the dip of the country before the high mountains beyond.  There were big bare patches now on the southern slope of the open glade below them and the snow was all dropped from the pine trees.  Then the plane was overhead, its shadows passing over the open glade, the throbbing reaching its maximum of portent
3		couldst			 "Thou couldst not send me and another with the small machine gun.  But I think in six months it should be long enough to hang well below my ears and in a year as long as thou couldst ever wish.  "I did not think thou couldst be the ruin thou appeared to be"
3		blasphemy			 "Oh, obscenity them," Primitivo said with an absolute devoutness of blasphemy, tears in his eyes and his cheeks twitching.  There are words for all the vile words in English and there are other words and expressions that are used only in countries where blasphemy keeps pace with the austerity of religion.  And this foul mouth stands there bringing more ill fortune with his blasphemies
3		wouldst			 "If thou hadst seen it thou wouldst not call it a novel," Primitivo said.  And she told me also that I must learn to speak Ingl�s and to speak it well so thou wouldst never be ashamed of me".  So thou wouldst understand"
3		jagged			 But he had hammered the jagged edges of the bullet hole smooth and driven a wooden plug into it and then cut the plug off and smoothed it even with the metal inside the helmet.  There were jagged pieces of steel on the bridge with their bright, new torn edges and ends and these were all over the road.  He kicked a jagged piece of steel off the surface of "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway238 the road

3		mucho			 "Eras mucho caballo," he said, meaning, "Thou wert plenty of horse". " And as the motorcycle passed the high gray trucks full of troops, gray trucks with high square cabs and square ugly radiators, steadily mounting the road in the dust and the flicking lights of the pursuing staff car, the red star of the army showing in the light when it passed over the tail gates, showing when the light came onto the sides of the dusty truck bodies, as they passed, climbing steadily now, the air colder and the road starting to turn in bends and switchbacks now, the trucks laboring and grinding, some steaming in the light flashes, the motorcycle laboring now too, and Andr�s clinging tight to the front seat as they climbed, Andr�s thought this ride on a motorcycle was mucho, mucho.

3		dove			 He almost dove behind the boulder.  As they dove on the hill for the last time with their machine guns hammering, the first plane pulled up and winged over and then each plane did the same and they moved from echelon to V- formation and went away into the sky in the direction of Segovia. " and he dug his heels in and leaned back hard onto the tension of the wire with a turn of it around his wrist and the noise of the truck was coming behind and ahead there was the road with the dead sentry and the long bridge and the stretch of road below, still clear and then there was a cracking roar and the middle of the bridge rose up in the air like a wave breaking and he felt the blast from the explosion roll back against him as he dove on his face in the pebbly gully with his hands holding tight over his head
3		weeping			 To thee do we send up our sighs, mournings and weepings in this valley of tears" "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway176 He went on with the prayer the horses' hooves soft on the fallen pine needles, the light coming through the tree trunks in patches as it comes through the columns of a cathedral, and as he prayed he looked ahead to see his flankers riding through the trees.  Nearly all were weeping but some were numb with what they had seen and the tears had dried in them.  Nearly all were weeping but some were numb with what they had seen and the tears had dried in them
3		anti-tank			 "Did you see anti-tank guns.  Just suppose that when the planes unload they smash those anti-tank guns and just blow hell out of the positions and the old tanks roll good up whatever hill it is for once and old Golz boots that bunch of drunks, clochards, bums, fanatics and heroes that make up the Quatorzieme Brigade ahead of him, and I know how good Dur�n's people are in Golz's other brigade, and we are in Segovia tomorrow night.  They'd be withdrawn a little way below in narrow trenches to escape the fragments, or hiding in the timber and when the bombers passed they'd get back up there with their machine guns and their automatic weapons and the anti-tank guns Jordan had said went up the road, and it would be one famous balls up more
3		cobarde			 But suppose the fear he had to go through and dominate and just get rid of finally in four years of that and then in the Indian fighting, although in that, mostly, there couldn't have been so much fear, had made a cobarde out of the other one the way second generation bullfighters almost always are.  I'll never forget how sick it made me the first time I knew he was a cobarde.  "En el fondo no soy cobarde," he said
3		soreness			 I do not wish to disappoint thee but there is a great soreness and much pain.  "There is always a great soreness and much pain," he said.  Also when I told her about this of the soreness she said I must not tell thee but must support the pain and not let thee know
3		gag			' "And he struck me again and again across the face with the braids which had been mine and then he put the two of them in my mouth and tied them tight around my neck, knotting them in the back to make a gag and the two holding me laughed. ' "And he struck me again and again across the face with the braids which had been mine and then he put the two of them in my mouth and tied them tight around my neck, knotting them in the back to make a gag and the two holding me laughed.  "Then the one who had gagged me ran a clippers all over my head; first from the forehead all the way to the back of the neck and then across the top and then all over my head and close behind my ears and they held me so I could see into the glass of the barber's mirror all the time that they did this and I could not believe it as I saw it done and I cried and I cried but I could not look away from the horror that my face made with the mouth open and the braids tied in it and my head coming naked under the clippers
3		sag			 "Karkov," a man of middle height with a gray, heavy, sagging face, puffed eye pouches and a pendulous under-lip called to him in a dyspeptic voice.  "Treat it softly but do not let it sag so it will foul.  "Treat it softly but do not let it sag so it will foul
3		poplar			 He knew where there was a trip wire laid that fired a set-gun and he located it in the dark, stepped over it, and started along the small stream bordered with poplars whose leaves were moving with the night wind.  A cock crowed at the farmhouse that was the fascist post and as he walked along the stream he looked back and saw, through the trunks of the poplars, a light showing at the lower edge of one of the windows of the farmhouse.  Andr�s, holding tight onto the seat where Gomez was forking the motor, bent his head against the wind as the motorcycle moved, noisily exploding, into the light-split darkness of the country road that opened ahead sharp with the high black of the poplars beside it, dimmed and yellow-soft now as the road dipped into the fog along a stream bed, sharpening hard again as the road rose and, ahead of them at the crossroads, the headlight showed the gray bulk of the empty trucks coming down from the mountains
3		partridge			 Just then, as knee deep in the gorse he climbed the steep slope that led to the Republican lines, a partridge flew up from under his feet, exploding in a whirr of wingbeats in the dark and he felt a sudden breath-stopping fright.  If there were not this war I would tie a handkerchief to the bush and come back in the daytime and search out the nest and I could take the eggs and put them under a setting hen and when they hatched we would have little partridges in the poultry yard and I would watch them grow and, when they were grown, I'd use them for callers.  But I would like to have it so that I could tie a handkerchief to that bush back there and come in the daylight and take the eggs and put them under a hen and be able to see the chicks of the partridge in my own courtyard
3		leche			 "Me cago en la leche," Andr�s shouted.  "But me cago en la leche, but I will be content when it starts".  "Me cago en la leche que me han dado
3		pannier			 He moved from the wall to the table and began filling his pockets with grenades from one of the rawhide-covered panniers that leaned, open, against the table leg.  Robert Jordan squatted by the pannier beside him.  He reached into the pannier and picked out four grenades
3		cotter			 Three were the oval Mill bomb type, serrated, heavy iron with a spring level held down in position by a cotter pin with pulling rig attached. " Robert Jordan held the graypainted grenade in his hand, trying the bend of the cotter pin with his thumbnail. , Robert Jordan thought as he felt the cotter pins that held the rings that would release the levers on the hand grenades
3		commissar			 "I don't need a political commissar," Robert Jordan told her.  "He is the chief commissar of the International Brigades".  "I am only a commissar, as you know," Marty told him
3		unbelieving			 Robert Jordan looked toward her and as he did he saw her mouth open and the unbelieving look come on her face and he swung toward the cave mouth reaching for his pistol.  "Thou" Pilar said to him unbelieving. " he asked, unbelieving
3		watery			 He recognized his bushy eyebrows, his watery gray eyes, his chin and the double chin under it, and he knew him for one of France's great modern revolutionary figures who had led the mutiny of the French Navy in the Black Sea.  The tall, heavy old man looked at Gomez with his outthrust head and considered him carefully with his watery eyes.  But instead of saying that Golz would only lean back away from the leaning bulk, the pushing finger, the watery gray eyes, the graywhite moustache and the bad breath and say, "Yes, Comrade Marty
3		loco			 "Est� loco," the guard said.  "Apesar de eso, est� loco," the corporal of the guard said.  "Est� loco"
3		girder			" and he thought, "Nice hunting, like hell, nice hunting," and just then he heard Anselmo shoot at the far end of the bridge, the noise of the shot clanging in the steel girders.  The girders were cold and wet with dew under his hands and he climbed carefully, feeling the sun on his back, bracing himself in a bridge truss, hearing the noise of the tumbling water below him, hearing firing, too much firing, up the road at the upper post. " smelling the fresh shingle smell of the new whittled wedges as he tapped them in tight to hold the charge between the girders
3		pullest			 When thou pullest hard, hard, the bridge will blow.  Keep it lightly firm but not pulling until thou pullest.  "When thou pullest really pull
2		eyepiece			 The young man, who was studying the country, took his glasses from the pocket of his faded, khaki flannel shirt, wiped the lenses with a handkerchief, screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he saw the wooden bench beside the door; the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular saw was, and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream.  Robert Jordan took his glasses from his shirt pocket and turned the eyepieces until the end of the bridge showed sharp and gray-painted-metal clear
2		kilometer			 It is at the roadmender's hut at kilometer five from the top of the pass".  Thy Golz is up the road three kilometers from here and to the right in the rocks of the forest"
2		sun-burned			 The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes, leaned over, put his arm through one of the leather pack straps and swung the heavy pack up onto his shoulders.  "Hello, Ingl�s," she answered and he saw her tawny brown face and the yellow-gray eyes and the full lips smiling and the cropped sun-burned hair and she lifted her face at him and smiled in his eyes
2		shaven			 That was the last he had seen of Golz with his strange white face that never tanned, his hawk eyes, the big nose and thin lips and the shaven head crossed with wrinkles and with scars.  He was clean shaven and he walked toward them from the mouth of the cave, moving with the bow-legged walk that went with his cattle herdsman's breeches and boots
2		watercress			 He sat now by the stream watching the clear water flowing between the rocks and, across the stream, he noticed there was a thick bed of watercress.  He sat now by the stream watching the clear water flowing between the rocks and, across the stream, he noticed there was a thick bed of watercress
2		stubbled			 Robert Jordan looked at the man's heavy, beard- stubbled face.  It was a peasant's face, the cheeks hollow under the high cheekbones, the beard stubbled, the eyes shaded by the heavy brows, big hands holding the rifle, heavy boots showing beneath the folds of the blanket cape
2		consummate			 Now we come for something of "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 8 consummate importance and thee, with thy dwelling place to be undisturbed, puts thy fox-hole before the interests of humanity.

2		whinny			 Ahead of them a horse whinnied in the timber and then, through the brown trunks of the pine trees, only a little sunlight coming down through their thick, almost-touching tops, he saw the corral made by roping around the tree trunks.  Just then one of the horses whinnied and from the open place below the opening through the rocks a horse answered, the neigh rising into a shrill sharply broken quaver
2		tarpaulin			 The horses had their heads pointed toward the men as they approached, and at the foot of a tree, outside the corral, the saddles were piled together and covered with a tarpaulin.  He pulled back the tarpaulin and showed the saddles
2		haunch			 Robert Jordan slipped through between the double rope of the corral and slapped the buckskin on the haunch.  Fernando was crouched on his haunches a little way from where they passed but he spoke with great dignity

2		manceuvre			 You speak of going to Gredos as though it were a military manceuvre to be accomplished.  "Well, we'll see if Golz can manceuvre them a little
2		negation			 Maria had turned and waved her hand at him and El Sordo waved disparagingly with the abrupt, Spanish upward flick of the forearm as though something were being tossed away which seems the negation of all salutation which has not to do with business.  There was little difference at first, although there was a definite beginning, as when the pump starts and the rubber of the tube crawls a little, but it came now as steadily as a tide rising or the sap rising in a tree until he began to feel the first edge of that negation of apprehension that often turned into actual happiness before action
2		absently			 "Listen, guapa," said Pilar and ran her finger now absently but tracingly over the contours of her cheeks.  "We could take thy happiness in a plane," he said absently
2		silliness			 "And lift thy head now because this silliness is over".  It reached an ultimate in silliness but tell me, what is thought of him in America
2		imperceptibly			 Pilar smiled and shrugged her shoulders almost imperceptibly and said, "You know the way.  It went slowly, almost imperceptibly, for it was a small watch and he could not see the second hand
2		unknowing			 For him it was a dark passage which led to nowhere, then to nowhere, then again to nowhere, once again to nowhere, always and forever to nowhere, heavy on the elbows in the earth to nowhere, dark, never any end to nowhere, hung on all time always to unknowing nowhere, this time and again for always to nowhere, now not to be borne once again always and to nowhere, now beyond all bearing up, up, up and into nowhere, suddenly, scaldingly, holdingly all nowhere gone and time absolutely still and they were both there, time having stopped and he felt the earth move out and away from under them.

2		bigoted			 He had gotten to be as bigoted and hidebound about his politics as a hard-shelled Baptist and phrases like enemies of the people came into his mind without his much criticizing them in any way.  To be bigoted you have to be absolutely sure that you are right and nothing makes that surety and righteousness like continence
2		heresy			 Continence is the foe of heresy.  It was a heresy of crackpots and wild men and it was really just an infantilism
2		blacklist			 I suppose that I am ticketed as a Red there now for good and will be on the general blacklist.  I suppose that I am ticketed as a Red there now for good and will be on the general blacklist

2		knee-high			 "Come on," Robert Jordan said and started to run toward her through the knee-high heather.  "Come on," Robert Jordan said and started to run toward her through the knee-high heather
2		domination			 But the spreading was a domination, not of evil, but of searching.  They were from his sister and Robert Jordan learned that everything was all right in Tafalla, that father was well, that mother was the same as always but with certain complaints about her back, that she hoped he was well and not in too great danger and she was happy he was doing away with the Reds to liberate Spain from the domination of the Marxist hordes
2		proven			" "Nay, it is common and proven knowledge with Gitanos".  There was quite a lot of religion in the letter and she prayed to Saint Anthony, to the Blessed Virgin of Pilar, and to other Virgins to protect him and she wanted him never to forget that he was also protected by the Sacred Heart of Jesus that he wore still, she trusted, at all times over his own heart where it had been proven innumerablethis was underlinedtimes to have the power of stopping bullets
2		ogre			 "I do not believe in ogres, soothsayers, fortune tellers, or chicken-crut gypsy witchcraft".  I do not believe in ogres, nor soothsayers, nor in the supernatural things"
2		soothsayer			 "I do not believe in ogres, soothsayers, fortune tellers, or chicken-crut gypsy witchcraft".  I do not believe in ogres, nor soothsayers, nor in the supernatural things"
2		sixty-five			 You don't know why those old eiderdowns cost sixty-five dollars, Robert Jordan thought.  Good old pig-eyes doesn't know why I paid the Woods boys sixty-five dollars for that robe
2		goaty			 It was just a little too goaty to be enjoyable.  There were two big sandwiches of meat and the goaty cheese apiece, and Robert Jordan had cut thick slices of onion with his clasp knife and put them on each side of the meat and cheese between the chunks of bread
2		judiciously			" "There are two kinds of storms," Pablo said, heavily and judiciously.  "Very well," Pablo said and nodded his head heavily and judiciously
2		gale			 In a blizzard, a gale, a sudden line squall, a tropical storm, or a summer thunder shower in the mountains there was an excitement that came to him from no other thing.  In a snowstorm the wind could blow a gale; but it blew a white cleanness and the air was full of a driving whiteness and all things were changed and when the wind stopped there would be the stillness
2		squall			 In a blizzard, a gale, a sudden line squall, a tropical storm, or a summer thunder shower in the mountains there was an excitement that came to him from no other thing.

2		whiteness			 In a snowstorm the wind could blow a gale; but it blew a white cleanness and the air was full of a driving whiteness and all things were changed and when the wind stopped there would be the stillness.  He looked through the tree trunks where the whiteness lay and up through the trees to where the sky was now clear
2		tenor			 In this country where no poor man can ever hope to make money unless he is a criminal like Juan March, or a bullfighter, or a tenor in the opera.  In this country where no poor man can ever hope to make money unless he is a criminal like Juan March, or a bullfighter, or a tenor in the opera
2		bicarbonate			 In a country where the bourgeoisie over-eat so that their stomachs are all ruined and they cannot live without bicarbonate of soda and the poor are hungry from their birth till the day they die, why wouldn't he be tubercular.  He felt much healthier in the war, probably due to the forced curtailment of the number of meat courses, he had an enormous stock of sodium- bicarbonate, he had his whiskey in the evening, his twenty-three-year-old mistress was having a baby, as were nearly all the other girls who had started out as milicianas in the July of the year before, and now he came into the room, nodded in answer to Gomez's salute and put out his hand
2		din			 I intervened to quiet Pastora and another Gitana intervened to quiet me and the din was such that no one could distinguish any words which passed except the one great word `whore' which roared out above all other words until quiet was restored and the three of us who had intervened sat looking down into our glasses and then I noticed that Finito was staring at the bull's head, still draped in the purple cloth, with a look of horror on his face.

2		untied			' "So the president of the Club reached the end of the speech and then, with everybody cheering him, he stood on a chair and reached up and untied the cord that bound the purple shroud over the head and slowly pulled it clear of the head and it stuck on one of the horns and he lifted it clear and pulled it off the sharp polished horns and there was that great yellow bull with black horns that swung Way out and pointed forward, their white tips sharp as porcupine quills, and the head of the bull was as though he were alive; his forehead was curly as in life and his nostrils were open and his eyes were bright and he was there looking straight at Finito.  Robert Jordan slipped out of his jacket, beat the snow from his trousers, and untied his shoes
2		blob			' very loudly and a big blob of blood came out and he didn't even put up the napkin and it slid down his chin and he was still looking at the bull and he said, `All season, yes. ' very loudly and a big blob of blood came out and he didn't even put up the napkin and it slid down his chin and he was still looking at the bull and he said, `All season, yes
2		epoch			' He looked around at the table and then he looked at the bull's head and said, `No,' once more and then he put his head down and he put his napkin up to his mouth and then he just sat there like that and said nothing and the banquet, which had started so well, and promised to mark an epoch in hilarity and good fellowship was not a success".  They are purging more than the epsom salts in this epoch"
2		welt			 Now, bending over the fire, she saw on the bed again the naked brown body with the gnarled scars in both thighs, the deep, seared whorl below the ribs on the right side of the chest and the long white welt along the side that ended in the armpit.  Now, bending over the fire, she saw on the bed again the naked brown body with the gnarled scars in both thighs, the deep, seared whorl below the ribs on the right side of the chest and the long white welt along the side that ended in the armpit
2		calve			 She saw the eyes closed and the solemn brown face and the curly black hair pushed back now from the forehead and she was sitting by him on the bed rubbing the legs, chafing the taut muscles of the calves, kneading them, loosening them, and then tapping them lightly with her folded hands, loosening the cramped muscles.  Then he saw the shape of the calves and the thighs in the tight, gray herdsman's breeches and the worn soles of the rope-soled shoes and he picked up Anselmo's carbine and the two sacks, practically empty now and went over and picked up the rifle that lay beside Fernando
2		tapping			 She saw the eyes closed and the solemn brown face and the curly black hair pushed back now from the forehead and she was sitting by him on the bed rubbing the legs, chafing the taut muscles of the calves, kneading them, loosening them, and then tapping them lightly with her folded hands, loosening the cramped muscles.  Then when the machine gun opened on them, they were like sharp hammer tappings
2		unfaithful			 She was with him thus five years and never was unfaithful to him, that is almost never, and then after the funeral, she took up with Pablo who led picador horses in the ring and was like all the bulls that Finito had spent his life killing.  But certainly we execute and destroy such veritable fiends and dregs of humanity and the treacherous dogs of generals and the revolting spectacle of admirals unfaithful to their trust
2		picador			 She was with him thus five years and never was unfaithful to him, that is almost never, and then after the funeral, she took up with Pablo who led picador horses in the ring and was like all the bulls that Finito had spent his life killing.  So, Ingl�s, it may be that thou art deaf to some things as Chicuelo and Marcial Lalanda and all of their banderilleros and picadors and all of the gente of Juan Luis and Manolo Granero were deaf to this thing on this day
2		steel-helmeted			 Anselmo saw the chauffeur, red-faced and steel-helmeted, his face and helmet projecting out of the blanket cape he wore and he saw the forward jut of the automatic rifle the orderly who sat beside the chauffeur carried.  Then another staff came behind them blasting with its klaxon and flicking its lights off and on, and each time the lights shone Andr�s saw the troops, steel-helmeted, their rifles vertical, their machine guns pointed up against the dark sky, etched sharp against the night that they dropped into when the light flicked off

2		sardine			 "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway108 "In this moon the first of the big schools of sardines come," the soldier who was cooking said.  "In this moon the sardine boats will be outfitting and the mackerel will have gone north"
2		pinch-bottle			 She looked at the pinch-bottle admiringly.  The old man sat down at the table on one of the hide-covered stools and Robert Jordan reached under the table and brought up the pinch-bottle of whiskey that had been the gift of Sordo
2		stubble-			 The dirty, stubble- faced man looked at him happily.  The small eyes, like a boar's, were watching her out of the round, stubble- covered head and Robert Jordan thought: I have known many killers in this war and some before and they were all different; there is no common trait nor feature; nor any such thing as the criminal type; but Pablo is certainly not handsome
2		agrarian			 "That is an agrarian reform which means something".  He had never thought of it before as an agrarian reform
2		equably			 "You are a woman and you do not understand," Pablo said equably. " "Nay," said Pablo equably
2		jovial			 He was almost jovial now.  I imagine it is not too jovial up at Sordo's
2		hissing			 It was so quiet in the cave, suddenly, that he could hear the hissing noise the wood made burning on the hearth where Pilar cooked.  17 The only noise in the cave now was the hissing from the hearth where snow was falling through the hole in the roof onto the coals of the fire
2		salud			 "Salud and Salud again," you salud, he thought.  Salud, you salud
2		swish			 "Nor words either," Pablo said and made a swishing noise rinsing the wine in his mouth.  It came again, the swishing like the noise of a rocket and there was another up-pulsing of dirt and smoke farther up the hillside
2		illusioned			 Then toasted them all, "To all the illusioned ones". " "I have thought you are a group of illusioned people," Pablo said
2		te			 "Qu� te importa, what have I thought".  "No te apures," he whispered to Agust�n
2		protruding			 He pulled the blanket coat over his head, the roundness of his head protruding now from the dirty yellow folds of the blanket.  From where they stood they could just see one of Agust�n's boots protruding from the rear of the blind

2		manicomio			 "But I can't stay any longer in this manicomio".  "A manicomio for criminal lunatics," Agust�n said
2		brassy			 He was conscious of Pablo across the table and of the others talking and playing cards and he smelled the odors of the cave which had changed now from those of the meal and the cooking to the fire smoke and man smell, the tobacco, red-wine and brassy, stale body smell, and when Maria, watching him finishing a drawing, put her hand on the table he picked it up with his left hand and lifted it to his face and smelled the coarse soap and water freshness from her washing of the dishes.  Pablo was standing close to him and he smelled the brassy, dead-wine smell that came from him like the taste of a copper coin in your mouth
2		besiege			 He had not liked Gaylord's, the hotel in Madrid the Russians had taken over when he first went there because it seemed too luxurious and the food was too good for a besieged city and the talk too cynical for a war.  There were sentries with bayonets downstairs outside the portecochere at Gaylord's and tonight it would be the pleasantest and most comfortable place in all of besieged Madrid
2		negroid			 At that, from what he had seen of Campesino, with his black beard, his thick negroid lips, and his feverish, staring eyes, he thought he might give almost as much trouble as a real peasant leader.

2		spitting			 Wearing black riding boots, gray breeches, and a gray tunic, with tiny hands and feet, puffily fragile of face and body, with a spitting way of talking through his bad teeth, he looked comic when Robert Jordan first saw him. " Andr�s would be ashamed, empty-feeling, proud and happy, and he would shake them all off and wash his hands and his right arm and wash his knife well and then take one of the wineskins and rinse the ear-taste out of his mouth for that year; spitting the wine on the stone flags of the plaza before he lifted the wineskin high and let the wine spurt into the back of his mouth

2		tram-line			 Robert Jordan had gone back to look for the tank which Montero said he thought might have stopped behind the apartment building on the corner of the tram-line.  Standing beside the door he had swung the dead man out and the dead man fell onto the sidewalk beside the tram-line still in that hunched-over, doubled-up position
2		overcoat			 He had on a long overcoat and he was bareheaded and his hair was gray, his cheekbones broad and his eyes were deep and set close together.  A large man, old and heavy, in an oversized khaki beret, such as chasseurs a pied wear in the French Army, wearing an overcoat, carrying a map case and wearing a pistol strapped around his greatcoat, got out of the back of the car with two other men in the uniform of the International Brigades
2		noncombatant			 But at the moment, when the man had handed him the cigarette, pushing it out almost like offering a tip for information, the combatant's hatred for the noncombatant had been too much for him.

2		superstition			 "That is ignorance and superstition".  I wonder if that is superstition
2		provocation			 "Such as thy arrival," Pablo said softly and Robert Jordan looked across the table at him, saw it was not a provocation but only an expressed thought, then went on.  Don't give any provocation
2		muerte			 "De la muerte," Pilar said.  It was, "Hay que tomar la muerte como si fuera aspirina," which means, "You will have to take death as an aspirin"
2		paseo			 Neither Marcial nor Chicuelo smelled it neither then nor when the four of them lined up for the paseo.  "Also you said that Blanquet smelled this just before the paseo
2		tendido			' "And it was on that afternoon that the bull Pocapena of the ranch of Veragua destroyed Manolo Granero against the planks of the barrier in front of tendido two in the Plaza de Toros of Madrid.  We were in the seventh row of the tendido three

2		bourgeois			 He was no gypsy but a bourgeois from Valencia.  He was no gypsy but a bourgeois from Valencia
2		gray-faced			 He was small, gray-faced and no one handled a cape better.  The Lieutenant-Colonel Miranda, who was a short, gray-faced man, who had been in the army all his life, who had lost the love of his wife in Madrid while he was losing his digestion in Morocco, and become a Republican when he found he could not divorce his wife (there was never any question of recovering his digestion), had entered the civil war as a Lieutenant-Colonel
2		porthole			 For part of it is the smell that comes when, on a ship, there is a storm and the portholes are closed up.  Put your nose against the brass handle of a screwed-tight porthole on a rolling ship that is swaying under you so that you are faint and hollow in the stomach and you have a part of that smell"
2		whisker			 When such an old woman comes out of the matadero, holding her shawl around hei with her face gray and her eyes hollow, and the whiskers of age on her chin, "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway139 and on her cheeks, set in the waxen white of her face as the sprouts grow from the seed of the bean, not bristles, but pale sprouts in the death of her face; put your arms tight around her, Ingl�s, and hold her to you and kiss her on the mouth and you will know the second part that odor is made of".

2		overlapping			 With this slab he scraped the ground clear of the snow along the rock wall and then picked up his boughs and shaking them clean of snow laid them in rows, like overlapping plumes, until he had a bed.  "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway160 The firing was rolling in overlapping waves
2		ioop			 He put the pistol in its holster on his belt and slipped the knot down on the lanyard and passed the ioop over his head.  Robert Jordan carried the wire clear past the end of the bridge, took a ioop around the last stanchion and then ran along the road until he stopped beside a stone marker
2		emplacement			 "Have you never had a proper emplacement for the gun.  I suppose it's smarter to use these rocks and build a good blind for this gun than to make a proper emplacement for it

2		lookout			 25 Robert Jordan looked up at where Primitivo stood now in his lookout post, holding his rifle and pointing.  Robert Jordan watched her climbing lithely up to his lookout post, the sack over her shoulder, the bucket in one hand, her cropped head bright in the sun

2		pompous			 You're getting awfully pompous.  You are getting very pompous in the early morning, he told himself
2		far-off			 Then he heard the far-off, distant throbbing and, looking up, he saw the planes.  But she could not do this and all the firing above and below the bridge and the distant sound of the battle that rolled down from the pass like the noise of a far-off storm with a dried, rolling rattle in it and the irregular beat of the bombs was simply a horrible thing that almost kept her from breathing
2		bareback			 He had only succeeded in stealing three horses last night and one had bolted when they tried to mount him bareback in the corral at the camp when the first shooting had started.  He had only succeeded in stealing three horses last night and one had bolted when they tried to mount him bareback in the corral at the camp when the first shooting had started
2		stupidness			 But we killed many when they made that stupidness.  Just as they were so proud of their automatic weapons that they made that stupidness
2		fifty-two			 He was fifty-two years old and he was sure this was the last time he would see that sky.  Sordo had accepted it but there was no sweetness in its acceptance even at fifty-two, with three wounds and him surrounded on a hill

2		bandit			 "Listen, bandits.  "What sort of a bandit is that with thee
2		crupper			" Sordo, his chest shaking, barely peeped past the horse's crupper and saw the captain on top of the boulder waving his arms.  And Pablo hit the horse across the crupper with a hobbling strap and it looked as though Maria tried to slip from the saddle but Pilar and Pablo were riding close up against her and Pilar was holding her and the three horses were going up the draw
2		squatting			 The sniper had gotten carefully behind the boulder again and Lieutenant Berrendo was squatting beside him.  Then she said, squatting by him, "How does it seem to thee now that it is really starting

Now Andr�s, holding again to the back of the seat ahead of him as the motorcycle climbed turn after switchback turn in a faint gray mist that lay over the top of the pass, felt the motorcycle speed under him, then skid and stop and they were standing by the motorcycle on a long, down-slope of road and in the woods, on their left, were tanks covered with pine branches
2		contrition			 Holy Mary, Mother of God," he started, then he remembered quickly as the roar came now unbearably and started an act of contrition racing in it, "Oh my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee who art worthy of all my love" Then there were the hammering explosions past his ears and the gun barrel hot against his shoulder.  It was hammering now in the roar and he could not remember the act of contrition

2		unreality			 Then suddenly surrendering to something, to the luxury of going into unreality, he said, "Let us talk of Madrid and of us in Madrid".

2		whitewashed			 Instead of sending Andr�s back to brigade headquarters with the motorcyclist, Gomez had decided to take him there himself in order to expedite things and, with Andr�s holding tight onto the seat ahead of him, they roared, bumping down the shell-pocked mountain road between the double row of big trees, the headlight of the motorcycle showing their whitewashed bases and the places on the trunks where the whitewash and the bark had been chipped and torn by shell fragments and bullets during the fighting along this road in the first summer of the movement.  In front of him was one of the whitewashed stones that marked the edge of the road
2		eyeshade			 They turned into the little smashed-roofed mountain- resort town where brigade headquarters was and Gomez had braked the motorcycle like a dirt-track racer and leaned it against the wall of the house where a sleepy sentry came to attention as Gomez pushed by him into the big room where the walls were covered with maps and a very sleepy officer with a green eyeshade sat at a desk with a reading lamp, two telephones and a copy of Mundo Obrero.  "Write them a very strong Salvoconducto to the Estado Mayor of General Golz for me to sign," he said to the officer in the green celluloid eyeshade

2		crossroad			 Andr�s, holding tight onto the seat where Gomez was forking the motor, bent his head against the wind as the motorcycle moved, noisily exploding, into the light-split darkness of the country road that opened ahead sharp with the high black of the poplars beside it, dimmed and yellow-soft now as the road dipped into the fog along a stream bed, sharpening hard again as the road rose and, ahead of them at the crossroads, the headlight showed the gray bulk of the empty trucks coming down from the mountains.

"Then until soon," Robert Jordan said and the old man went off, noiseless on his rope- soled shoes, swinging wide through the trees
2		klaxon			 There was a motorcar behind them now and it blasted into the truck noise and the dust with its klaxon again and again; then flashed on lights that showed the dust like a solid yellow cloud and surged past them in a whining rise of gears and a demanding, threatening, bludgeoning of klaxoning.  Then another staff came behind them blasting with its klaxon and flicking its lights off and on, and each time the lights shone Andr�s saw the troops, steel-helmeted, their rifles vertical, their machine guns pointed up against the dark sky, etched sharp against the night that they dropped into when the light flicked off

Suppose we got a break-through today
2		chitter			 A squirrel chittered from a pine tree below him and Robert Jordan watched the squirrel come down the tree "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway231 trunk, stopping on his way down to turn his head and look toward where the man was watching.

1		pine-needled			 John Donne 1 He lay flat on the brown, pine-needled floor of the forest, his chin on his folded arms, and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees
1		photostat			 He spread the photostated military map out on the forest floor and looked at it carefully
1		iron-stiff			 He was a short and solid old man in a black peasant's smock and gray iron-stiff trousers and he wore rope-soled shoes
1		flume			 The young man, who was studying the country, took his glasses from the pocket of his faded, khaki flannel shirt, wiped the lenses with a handkerchief, screwed the eyepieces around until the boards of the mill showed suddenly clearly and he saw the wooden bench beside the door; the huge pile of sawdust that rose behind the open shed where the circular saw was, and a stretch of the flume that brought the logs down from the mountainside on the other bank of the stream
1		smooth-			 The stream showed clear and smooth- looking in the glasses and, below the curl of the falling water, the spray from the dam was blowing in the wind
1		millhouse			 "There is smoke coming from the millhouse," the old man said
1		sun-streaked			 The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes, leaned over, put his arm through one of the leather pack straps and swung the heavy pack up onto his shoulders
1		wind-			 The young man, who was tall and thin, with sun-streaked fair hair, and a wind- and sun-burned face, who wore the sun-faded flannel shirt, a pair of peasant's trousers and rope-soled shoes, leaned over, put his arm through one of the leather pack straps and swung the heavy pack up onto his shoulders

1		steeper			 The climbing now was steeper and more difficult, until finally the stream seemed to drop down over the edge of a smooth granite ledge that rose above them and the old man waited at the foot of the ledge for the young man to come up to him
1		twitchy			 He was sweating heavily and his thigh muscles were twitchy from the steepness of the climb
1		hand-holds			 It was not hard to climb and from the way he found hand-holds without searching for them the young man could see that he had climbed it many times before
1		lamplight			 "To blow the bridge is nothing," Golz had said, the lamplight on his scarred, shaved head, pointing with a pencil on the big map
1		scarred			 "To blow the bridge is nothing," Golz had said, the lamplight on his scarred, shaved head, pointing with a pencil on the big map
1		annul			 What is to guarantee that the attack is not annulled
1		croak			 "Hotze," he croaked
1		pronounced			 If I had known how they pronounced Golz in Spanish I would pick me out a better name before I come to war here
1		long-bodied			 Tomorrow night they would be outside the Escorial in the dark along the road; the long lines of trucks loading the infantry in the darkness; the men, heavy loaded, climbing up into the trucks; the machine-gun sections lifting their guns into the trucks; the tanks being run up on the skids onto the long-bodied tank trucks; pulling the Division out to move them in the night for the attack on the pass
1		peppery-tasting			 He crossed the stream, picked a double handful, washed the muddy roots clean in the current and then sat down again beside his pack and ate the clean, cool green leaves and the crisp, peppery-tasting stalks
1		achingly			 The water was achingly cold
1		beard-			 Robert Jordan looked at the man's heavy, beard- stubbled face
1		half-mocking			 "He is the boss here," he grinned, then flexed his arms as though to make the muscles "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 7 stand out and looked at the man with the carbine in a half-mocking admiration
1		unpin			 Robert Jordan unpinned a safety pin that ran through his pocket flap and took a folded paper out of the left breast pocket of his flannel shirt and handed it to the man, who opened it, looked at it doubtfully and turned it in his hands
1		fox-hole			 Now we come for something of "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 8 consummate importance and thee, with thy dwelling place to be undisturbed, puts thy fox-hole before the interests of humanity
1		sixty-eight			 "Thou art more wolf than me and I am sixty-eight years old"
1		sullenness			 "I will take it," Pablo told him, and in his sullenness there was a sadness that was disturbing to Robert Jordan
1		alpargatas			 I wonder if he has a pair of boots or if he rides in those alpargatas, he thought
1		sell-out			 That is the sadness that comes before the sell-out
1		almost-touching			 Ahead of them a horse whinnied in the timber and then, through the brown trunks of the pine trees, only a little sunlight coming down through their thick, almost-touching tops, he saw the corral made by roping around the tree trunks
1		sad-looking			 Pablo and Anselmo knew how good they were and while Pablo stood now proud and less sad-looking, watching them lovingly, the old man acted as though they were some great surprise that he had produced, suddenly, himself
1		ornate			 There were two ordinary vaquero's or herdsman's saddles, like American stock saddles, one very ornate vaquero's saddle, with hand-tooled leather and heavy, hooded stirrups, and two military saddles in black leather

1		dead-fall			 "With a log for a dead-fall

1		dexterous			 "But very dexterous at producing explosions," the gypsy said

1		chu-chu-chu-chu-chu-			 Then it came chu-chu-chu-chu-chu- chu steadily larger and larger and then, at the moment of the explosion, the front wheels of the engine rose up and all of the earth seemed to rise in a great cloud of blackness and a roar and the engine rose high in the cloud of dirt and of the Wooden ties rising in the air as in a dream and then it fell onto its side like a great wounded animal and there was an explosion of white steam before the clods of the other explosion had ceased to fall on us and the m�quina commenced to speak ta-tat-tat-ta

1		stagnation			 Here is a stagnation that is repugnant"
1		heartburn			 "It gives me heartburn"
1		unnecessarily			 "In this way it is better not to speak of it unnecessarily"
1		solid-flung			 It was wide enough for two motor cars to pass and it spanned, in solid-flung metal grace, a deep gorge at the bottom of which, far below, a brook leaped in white water through rocks and boulders down to the main stream of the pass
1		lessened			 Then the "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway 21 sun lessened and was gone and looking up through the trees at the brown, rounded height that it had gone behind, he saw, now, that he no longer looked into the glare, that the mountain slope was a delicate new green and that there were patches of old snow under the crest
1		trueness			 Then he was watching the bridge again in the sudden short trueness of the little light that would be left, and studying its construction
1		scientifically			 It could be done unhurriedly, scientifically and correctly with a half dozen charges laid and braced to explode simultaneously; or it could be done roughly with two big ones
1		senty			 Robert Jordan put up his field glasses, shading the lenses carefully with his cupped hands even though there was now no sun to make a glint, and there was the rail of the bridge as clear as though you could reach out and touch it and there was the face of the senty so clear he could see the sunken cheeks, the ash on the cigarette and the greasy shine of the bayonet
1		fire-blackened			 There were some fire-blackened empty tins in the ashes under it
1		veo			 "Ya lo veo," he said in Spanish
1		enlarged			 At this point it was enlarged from the old road to its present width by cutting into the solid bastion of the rock on the far side of the gorge; and its left or western edge, looking down from the pass and the bridge, was marked and protected by a line of upright cut blocks of stone where its edge fell sheer away to the gorge
1		unshapely			" Anselmo said softly as they watched the sentry walk across the bridge toward the other box, his bayonet bright in the last of the afterglow, his figure unshapely in the blanket coat
1		monoplane			 Then through this noise came another noise, a steady, racketing drone and they saw the sentry looking up, his knitted cap slanted back, and turning their heads and looking up they saw, high in the evening sky, three monoplanes in V formation, showing minute and silvery at that height where there still was sun, passing unbelievably quickly across the sky, their motors now throbbing steadily
1		wing-tipped			 Now, as they moved out of sight toward Segovia, they did not look to be the green, red wing-tipped, low wing Russian conversion of the Boeing P32 that the Spaniards called Moscas
1		embalmer			 There were the horns of ibex that I had killed in the high Sierra, and there was an eagle stuffed by an embalmer of birds of Avila, with his wings spread, and eyes as yellow and real as the eyes of an eagle alive
1		unthinkable			 Such a barbarity is unthinkable
1		timbet			 I would make them work each day as we have worked in the fields and as we work in the mountains with the timbet all of the rest of their lives
1		bravado			 "It should be of the highest interest," Anselmo said and hearing him say it honestly and clearly and with no pose, neither the English pose of understatement nor any Latin bravado, Robert Jordan thought he was very lucky to have this old man and having seen the bridge and worked out and simplified the problem it would have been to surprise the posts and blow it in a normal way, he resented Golz's orders, and the necessity for them

1		comest			 And when thou comest to the camp, order that some one should relieve me because I have indescribable and unprintable hunger and I have forgotten the password"

1		pack-sack			 Deep in one pack he felt the bundled blocks in the sacks, the sacks wrapped in the sleeping robe, and tying the strings of that and pushing the lock shut again, he put his hands into the other and felt the sharp wood outline of the box of the old exploder, the cigar box with the caps, each little cylinder wrapped round and round with its two wires (the lot of them packed as carefully as he had packed his collection of wild bird eggs when he was a boy), the stock of the submachine gun, disconnected from the barrel and wrapped in his leather jacket, the two pans and five clips in one of the inner pockets of the big pack-sack arid the small coils of copper wire and the big coil of light insulated Wire in the other
1		awl			 In the pocket with the wire he felt his pliers and the two wooden awls for making holes in the end of the blocks and then, from the last inside pocket, he took a big box of the Russian cigarettes of the lot he had from Golz's headquarters and tying the mouth of the pack shut, he pushed the lock in, buckled the flaps down and again covered both packs with the canvas
1		tallow			 There was a table along one wall with a tallow candle stuck in a bottle on it and at the table were seated Pablo, three men he did not know, and the gypsy, Rafael
1		bellows			 She lifted the wooden spoon out and looked at Robert Jordan as he stood there in the doorway and he saw, in the glow from the fire the woman was blowing with a bellows, the girl's face, her arm and the drops running down from the spoon and dropping into the iron pot
1		warship			 He ran his thumbnail along the side of the paper box with the big colored figure of a warship on the cover and pushed the box toward Pablo
1		milky			 It was a milky yellow now with the water and he hoped the gypsy would not take more than a swallow
1		kiosques			 There was very little of it left and one cup of it took the place of the evening papers, of all the old evenings in caf�s, of all chestnut trees that would be in bloom now in this month, of the great slow horses of the outer boulevards, of book shops, of kiosques, and of galleries, of the Parc Montsouris, of the Stade Buffalo, and of the Butte Chaumont, of the Guaranty Trust Company and the Ile de la Cite, of Foyot's old hotel, and of being able to read and relax in the evening; of all the things he had enjoyed and forgotten and that came back to him when he tasted that opaque, bitter, tongue-numbing, brain-warming, stomach-warming, idea-changing liquid alchemy

1		-eight			 One looked to be about twenty-six or -eight, the other perhaps two years older
1		surgically			 Robert Jordan watched Pablo and as he watched, letting his right hand hang lower and lower, ready if it should be necessary, half hoping it would be (feeling perhaps that were the simplest and easiest yet not wishing to spoil what had gone so well, knowing how quickly all of a family, all of a clan, all of a band, can turn against a stranger in a quarrel, yet thinking what could be done with the hand were the simplest and best and surgically the most sound now that this had happened), saw also the wife of Pablo standing there and watched her blush proudly and soundly and healthily as the allegiances were given

1		tactical			 "You treat a man as coward because he has a tactical sense
1		unrhetorical			" Pablo said to him seriously and Robert Jordan saw how unrhetorical was the question
1		bedside			 Now she was mimicking a visit to a bedside, "Hello, old timer
1		effeminate			 She commenced to laugh, dropping the imitation of the almost effeminate bullfighter's voice and booming again now
1		suilenly			 "I should shoot thee and the foreigner both," Pablo said suilenly
1		authoritatively			 "A cup of water for me," Robert Jordan said, not taking his eyes from the man with his sullen heavy head and the woman standing proudly and confidently holding the big spoon as authoritatively as though it were a baton
1		chafed			 He had slipped the safety catch and he felt the worn comfort of the checked grip chafed almost smooth and touched the round, cool companionship of the trigger guard
1		contemplatively			 He looked at him a long time contemplatively and then he looked back at the woman, again
1		enameled-ware			 The girl came in and walked across to the low table by the hearth and picked up the enameled-ware bowls and brought them to the table

1		saffron			 There was no wind, and, outside now of the warm air of the cave, heavy with smoke of both tobacco and charcoal, with the odor of cooked rice and meat, saffron, pimentos, and oil, the tarry, wine-spilled smell of the big skin hung beside the door, hung by the neck and the four legs extended, wine drawn from a plug fitted in one leg, wine that spilled a little onto the earth of the floor, settling the dust smell; out now from the odors of different herbs whose names he did not know that hung in bunches from the ceiling, with long ropes of garlic, away now from the copper-penny, red wine and garlic, horse sweat and man sweat dried in the clothing (acrid and gray the man sweat, sweet and sickly the dried brushed-off lather of horse sweat), of the men at the table, Robert Jordan breathed deeply of the clear night air of the mountains that smelled of the pines and of the dew on the grass in the meadow by the stream

1		unexplained			 It was just another sudden unexplained rarity of this war
1		light-split			 Andr�s, holding tight onto the seat where Gomez was forking the motor, bent his head against the wind as the motorcycle moved, noisily exploding, into the light-split darkness of the country road that opened ahead sharp with the high black of the poplars beside it, dimmed and yellow-soft now as the road dipped into the fog along a stream bed, sharpening hard again as the road rose and, ahead of them at the crossroads, the headlight showed the gray bulk of the empty trucks coming down from the mountains

1		good-			 He felt "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway217 very young now and very awkward and he was saying good-by as awkwardly as one can be when saying good-by to a young girl when you are a boy in school, saying good- by at the front porch, not knowing whether to kiss the girl or not
1		grooving			 Walking carefully, downhill, Anselmo in the lead, Agust�n next, Robert Jordan placing his feet carefully so that he would not slip, feeling the dead pine needles under his rope- soled shoes, bumping a tree root with one foot and putting a hand forward and feeling the cold metal jut of the automatic rifle barrel and the folded legs of the tripod, then working sideways down the hill, his shoes sliding and grooving the forest floor, putting his left hand out again and touching the rough bark of a tree trunk, then as he braced himself his hand feeling a smooth place, the base of the palm of his hand coming away sticky from the resinous sap where a blaze had been cut, they dropped down the steep wooded hillside to the point above the bridge where Robert Jordan and Anselmo had watched the first day

1		bludgeon			 There was a motorcar behind them now and it blasted into the truck noise and the dust with its klaxon again and again; then flashed on lights that showed the dust like a solid yellow cloud and surged past them in a whining rise of gears and a demanding, threatening, bludgeoning of klaxoning

1		right-hand			 As Gomez started the motorcycle ahead onto the now clear right-hand side of the road past the wrecked truck, Andr�s, holding tight again, saw the control guard halting another truck and the driver leaning from the cab and listening to him
1		etched			 Then another staff came behind them blasting with its klaxon and flicking its lights off and on, and each time the lights shone Andr�s saw the troops, steel-helmeted, their rifles vertical, their machine guns pointed up against the dark sky, etched sharp against the night that they dropped into when the light flicked off

1		wooden-holstered			 Gomez leaned the motorcycle against the wall as a motorcyclist in a leather suit, showing against the light from inside the building as the door opened, came out of the door with a dispatch case hung over his shoulder, a wooden-holstered Mauser pistol swung against his hip

1		brown-thin-lined			 But at the General Staff where, because of the system of Political Commissars, he could intervene as the political head of the Brigades, he would put his finger on such and such a numbered, brown-thin-lined encircled spot among the greens of woods cut by the lines of roads that parallel the never casual winding of a river and say, "There

1		diggings			 Gall and Copic, who were men of politics and of ambition, would agree and later, men who never saw the map, but heard the number of the hill before they left their starting place and had the earth of diggings on it pointed out, would climb its side to find their death along its slope or, being halted by machine guns placed in olive groves would never get up it at all

1		scarheaded			 But when Marty put his finger on the map in Golz's staff the scarheaded, white-faced General's jaw muscles would tighten and he would think, "I should shoot you, Andr� Marty, before I let you put that gray rotten finger on a contour map of mine

1		moto			 "Put thy moto out of sight and cover it with these"
1		timbered			 They stood outside while the chauffeur went in and Andr�s admired the construction of the dugout which showed only as a hole in the hillside, with no dirt scattered about, but which he could see, from the entrance, was both deep and profound with men moving around in it freely with no need to duck their heads under the heavy timbered roof
1		branch-covered			 They were passing the branch-covered, mud-colored tanks, each with two deep- ridged tracks over the pine needles showing where they had swung and backed from the road

1		lightening			 He loved this hour of the day always and now he watched it; feeling it gray within him, as though he were a part of the slow lightening that comes before the rising of the sun; when solid things darken and space lightens and the lights that have shone in the night go yellow and then fade as the day comes
1		wisp			 The pine trunks below him were hard and clear now, their trunks solid and brown and the road was shiny with a wisp of mist over it
1		spidery			 But as he looked the structure of the bridge was still spidery and fine in the mist that hung over the stream

1		all-leather			 Once a motorcyclist in a leather coat and all-leather helmet with an automatic rifle in a holster by his left leg came across the bridge and went on up the road
1		thudding			 He lay there behind the pine tree, with the submachine gun across his left forearm, and he never looked at the sentry box again until, long after it seemed that it was never coming, that nothing could happen on such a lovely late May morning, he heard the sudden, clustered, thudding of the bombs
1		unshaved			 The knitted cap was on the side of his head and the sun was on his unshaved face as he looked up into the sky toward where the planes were bombing
1		foresight			 Robert Jordan felt his own breath tight now as though a strand of wire bound his chest and, steadying his elbows, feeling the corrugations of the forward grip against his fingers, he put the oblong of the foresight, settled now in the notch of the rear, onto the center of the man's chest and squeezed the trigger gently
1		rifle-firing			 Then he heard rifle-firing up the road and from below came the noise of Pablo's cavalry automatic rifle spat-spat-spat-spatting into the noise of grenades

1		trestling			 "The other side now, viejo," he shouted up to Anselmo and climbed across through the trestling, like a bloody Tarzan in a rolled steel forest, he thought, and then coming out from under the dark, the stream tumbling below him, he looked up and saw Anselmo's face as he reached the packages of explosive down to him
1		flare-up			 I wonder what that second flare-up was
1		pebbled			 He looked down and saw it boiling up white below him through the boulders and then dropping down to a clear pebbled pool where one of the wedges he had dropped swung around in the current

1		washed-out			 Then he was on the road and it was still clear below on the road and then he was moving fast backwards up the little washed-out gully by the lower side of the road as an outfielder goes backwards for a long fly ball, keeping the wire taut, and now he was almost opposite Anselmo's stone and it was still clear below the bridge
1		outfielder			 Then he was on the road and it was still clear below on the road and then he was moving fast backwards up the little washed-out gully by the lower side of the road as an outfielder goes backwards for a long fly ball, keeping the wire taut, and now he was almost opposite Anselmo's stone and it was still clear below the bridge
1		pebbly			" and he dug his heels in and leaned back hard onto the tension of the wire with a turn of it around his wrist and the noise of the truck was coming behind and ahead there was the road with the dead sentry and the long bridge and the stretch of road below, still clear and then there was a cracking roar and the middle of the bridge rose up in the air like a wave breaking and he felt the blast from the explosion roll back against him as he dove on his face in the pebbly gully with his hands holding tight over his head
1		sol			 Then he saw the shape of the calves and the thighs in the tight, gray herdsman's breeches and the worn soles of the rope-soled shoes and he picked up Anselmo's carbine and the two sacks, practically empty now and went over and picked up the rifle that lay beside Fernando

1		stocky			 Robert Jordan saw Pablo, short, heavy and stocky, his cap gone, leaning against the rock wall and firing the short cavalry automatic rifle and he could see the bright flicker of the cascading brass hulls as the sun caught them
1		bowlegged			 Then, without looking back, he came running, short, bowlegged, fast, his head bent down straight toward the bridge
1		low-bodied			 It was then he saw the low-bodied, angled snout and squat green, gray and brown-splashed turret with the projecting machine gun come around the bend into the bright sun

1		botfly			 Now they could see the horses tied to the trees, the sun coming down on them through the pine branches and them tossing their heads and kicking against the botflies and Robert Jordan saw Maria and the next thing he was holding her tight, tight, with the automatic rifle leaning against his side, the flash-cone pressing against his ribs and Maria saying, "Thou, Roberto
1		breathless			 Then Pilar came up, so breathless from the climb she could not talk, but only motioned
1		duffle			 He was wearing rope-soled shoes and the stirrups were a little too short; his submachine gun was slung over his shoulder, his pockets were full of clips and he was sitting reloading the one used clip, the reins under one arm, tight, watching Pilar mount into a strange sort of seat on top of the duffle lashed onto the saddle of the buckskin
1		soft-heeled			" Agust�n wheeled beside him, kicking his soft-heeled, canvas shoes against the stiff, unresponding belly of one of the horses Pablo had recruited in the night

1		pine-			 Just then Pablo dug both his spurs into the big bay and he plunged down the last pine- needled slope and cross the road in a pounding, sparking of shod hooves
1		sweeeish-crack-boom			 Then he heard a noise come sweeeish-crack-boom
1		up-pulsing			 It came again, the swishing like the noise of a rocket and there was another up-pulsing of dirt and smoke farther up the hillside
1		kneeing			 He saw the gypsy's hand extended behind him, rising higher and higher, seeming to take forever as his heels kicked into the horse he was riding and the rope came taut, then dropped, and he was across the road and Robert Jordan was kneeing against a frightened packhorse that bumped back into him as the gypsy crossed the hard, dark road and he heard his horse's hooves clumping as he galloped up the slope

1		jink			 The flat trajectory of the shell came and he saw the gypsy jink like a running boar as the earth spouted the little black and gray geyser ahead of him
1		dirt-spouting			 The gun was firing now with the rocket whish and the cracking, dirt-spouting boom
1		foreshorten			 It crossed in profile now without foreshortening and in the center was the broken place and behind it on the road was the little tank and behind the little tank was a big tank with a gun that flashed now yellow-bright as a mirror and the screech as the air ripped apart seemed almost over the gray neck that stretched ahead of him, and he turned his head as the dirt fountained up the hillside

1		surging			" and felt his big horse's chest surging with the steepening of the slope and saw the gray neck stretching and the gray ears ahead and he reached and patted the wet gray neck, and he looked back at the bridge and saw the bright flash from the heavy, squat, mud-colored tank there on the road and then he did not hear any "For Whom the Bell Tolls" By Ernest Hemingway246 whish but only a banging acrid smelling clang like a boiler being ripped apart and he was under the gray horse and the gray horse was kicking and he was trying to pull out from under the weight
1		knee-ed			 Then he knew what it was all right and just then the gray horse knee-ed himself up and Robert Jordan's right leg, that had kicked the stirrup loose just as it should, slipped clear over the saddle and came down beside him and he felt with his two hands of his thigh bone where the left leg lay flat against the ground and his hands both felt the sharp bone and where it pressed against the skin
1		sweat-streaked			 The sweat-streaked, bristly face bent down by him and Robert Jordan smelt the full smell of Pablo
1		contort			 The sun was on her hair and her face was twisted as a child's contorts before it cries
1		lefthand			 Pilar took her knife and slit his trouser leg down below the lefthand pocket
1		sharp-peaked			 Ten inches below the hip joint there was a pointed, purple swelling like a sharp-peaked little tent and as he touched it with his fingers he could feel the snapped-off thigh bone tight against the skin

1		half-looking			 He jerked his head at Pablo, who was half-looking at him from the tree and Pablo started over
1		han			 "Me cago en la leche que me han dado
1		bitchery			 "War is a bitchery"
1		bile			 He felt empty and drained and exhausted from all of it and from them going and his mouth tasted of bile
1		timber-covered			 He looked down across the green slope, seeing the gray horse where Agust�n had shot him, and on down the slope to the road with the timber-covered country behind it
1		extra-sensory			 What about extra-sensory perception
1		instep			 Then with his broken leg, held by both hands, uphill, he put the sole of his right foot against the instep of his left foot and pressed hard while he rolled, sweating, over onto his face and chest
1		mixed-up			 I do not want to get in any sort of mixed-up state before they come
1		cooped			 Or if we were all cooped up here waiting for it
1		transmitter			 We ought to have portable short wave transmitters
1		sweatily			 He grinned at that sweatily because the leg, where the big nerve had been bruised by the fall, was hurting badly now
1		sunlit			 He was waiting until the officer reached the sunlit place where the first trees of the pine forest joined the green slope of the meadow
